\chapter{Introduction}

Stability of two-phase natural circulation systems is not a novel subject in and of itself.
However, this work aims to perform analysis on a novel geometry with unique characteristics using rigorous numerical methods.
Motivation for this effort is given through the examination of an experimental facility and preliminary data, both experimental and numerical.
Then, a literature overview of the field of stability analysis of fluid systems is presented with a broader perspective than that of this work.
Finally, the chapter concludes with the end goals of this investigation and an outline of the work.

\section{Research Purpose}\label{Section:Purpose}

The purpose of this research is to theoretically investigate the linear stability of a closed loop, natural circulation system undergoing phase-change with water as a working fluid.
The goal is to ultimately apply stability theory to three parallel channels in a closed circuit with mass loss.
While the geometry may be a simple extension of other works, a defining characteristic of this system is that of mass loss.
As the system boils, the inventory is draining and a question that has not been completely answered is how does this affect the stability and overall evolution of the system.
In addition to the geometrical considerations, this work also explores a novel discretization scheme to the standard set of thermohydraulic equations that aims to more accurately represent branching flows than standard channel flow models.
Also, this work applies a full non-linear solver to the set of discretized equations with no operator splitting over a time-step.
Lastly, the linear stability of the system over a transient is determined through a detailed volume integration of the governing equations and an eigenvalue calculation.


The outline of the topics to be discussed in this work is:
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,itemsep=2pt]
    \item{conservation laws and pertinent thermohydraulic equations to solve;}
    \item{the discretization scheme and approximations applied to the equations;}
    \item{stability theory as applied to the set of nonlinear equations;}
    \item{the nonlinear solver used;}
    \item{results of transient simulations and associated stability calculations;}
    \item{conclusions from the presented results and future work.}
\end{enumerate}
Each section builds upon the last and works to fulfill the delineated goals above.
