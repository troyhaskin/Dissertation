\section{Literature}
Two-phase flow instabilities have been extensively studied across numerous industrial applications, including thermosiphons and power cycle loops; therefore, the literature of two-phase flow instabilities is extensive.
It should be noted that single phase instabilities do exist and are researched \cite{satoh_instability_1998}, but an in-depth overview of those mechanisms will not be given.
An overview of two-phase instabilities, classifications, and definitions is given below.
Then, specific discussion of efforts and techniques of analysis is discussed.
