\chapter{Theory}\label{Chapter:Theory}

In this chapter, the theory of conservation laws, discretization of differential equations, solution of nonlinear equations, and calculation of linear stability are all discussed.
Because the stability analysis in this work hinges upon the ability to accurately integrate the computational domain, the first three sections discuss the fully nonlinear equations and their solution.
The last section then covers the final linearization process to create an eigenvalue problem from the thermohydraulic equations to gain insight into a system's stability.
