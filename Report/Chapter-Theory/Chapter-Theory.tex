\chapter{Theory}\label{Chapter:Theory}

In this chapter, the underlying theory of the previous chapter is explained.
Basic conservation laws for \TH are presented for both single and two-phase flow in one-spatial direction.
The numerical solution of these laws is then discussed.
Concluding the chapter, an overview of stability analysis of systems is given.
