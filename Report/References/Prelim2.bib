	abstract = {A dynamic model for natural circulation boiling water reactors {(BWRs)} under low-pressure conditions is developed. The motivation for this theoretical research is the concern about the stability of natural circulation {BWRs} during the low-pressure reactor start-up phase. There is experimental and theoretical evidence for the occurrence of void ?ashing in the unheated riser under these conditions. This ?ashing effect is included in the differential (homogeneous equilibrium) equations for two-phase ?ow. The differential equations were integrated over axial two-phase nodes, to derive a nodal time-domain model. The dynamic behavior of the interface between the one an two-phase regions is approximated with a linearized model. All model equations are presented in a dimensionless form. As an example the stability characteristics of the Dutch Dodewaard reactor at low pressure are determined.},

	abstract = {The heat transport capability of natural circulation loops is directly proportional to the flow rate it can generate. Therefore, reliable prediction of flow rate is essential for design and performance evaluation of natural circulation loops. The reported generalized flow equation applicable for single-phase natural circulation is only valid for cases where the entire loop follows a single friction law. Such a situation arises when the natural circulation loop is either fully laminar or fully turbulent. It is possible that a natural circulation loop can be partly laminar and partly in transition or turbulent flow. In such cases, a single friction law is not applicable throughout the loop. In the present study, a generalized flow equation is proposed for cases where a single friction law is not applicable for the entire loop. The proposed equation is tested with experimental data generated in a uniform diameter rectangular loop and is found to be in good agreement. Subsequently the equation is tested with data reported in the literature. Stability analysis reported in literature for single-phase loops are either for laminar or turbulent flows. In practice, in natural circulation loops, all the flow regimes like laminar, transition and turbulent are observed. Therefore, it is required to develop a stability map, which is valid for all the three regions. In the present paper, such a stability map is presented.},

	abstract = {In order to study the two-phase natural circulation and flow termination during a small break loss of coolant accident in {LWR}, a hot leg U-bend simulation loop has been built based on the two-phase flow scaling criteria developed under this program. The nitrogen-water system has been used to isolate the key hydrodynamic phenomena from heat transfer problems. Various tests were carried out to establish the basic mechanism of the flow termination and reestablishment as well as to obtain essential information on scale effects of various parameters such as the loop frictional resistance, thermal center, U-bend curvature, and inlet geometry. It was found that the permanent termination of the natural circulation was related to the head balance between the hot and cold legs. The local flow condition at the inverted U-bend could produce intermittent flow, however was not related to the permanent flow termination. The void distribution in a hot leg, flow regime, and natural circulation rate have been measured in detail for various conditions. Significant effects of the inlet geometry on these were observed. Near the flow termination condition, large amplitude flow oscillations occurred. The occurrence of this type of flow instability is important for safety analyses, because it may lead to loop-to-loop oscillations or flow excursions in a prototype system which has a multi-loop configuration.},

The novel manner of visualizing the results allowed characterizing the facility at any time and position which helped to thoroughly understand the instability mechanisms. Different modes were observed for each configuration. In the case of having two-parallel channels, four different behaviors have been observed: stable flow circulation, periodic high subcooling oscillations, a-periodical oscillations and out-of-phase periodical oscillations. In addition, stability maps were constructed in order to clarify the region in which each mode is dominant. The results obtained from both the one and two-parallel channels configurations are thus analyzed and compared. As a result, some similarities have been observed between the intermittent flow oscillations found in the single channel experiments and the high subcooling oscillations found in the two-parallel channels experiments. Moreover, similarities have also been found between the sinusoidal flow oscillations existing in the single channel experiments and the out-of-phase oscillations from the two-parallel channels experiments. The experiments presented in this work can be used to benchmark numerical codes and modeling techniques developed to study the start-up of natural circulation {BWRs.}},

	abstract = {During the start-up phase, natural circulation {BWRs} {(NC-BWRs)} need to be operated at low pressure conditions. Such conditions favor flashing-induced instabilities due to the large hydrostatic pressure drop induced by the tall chimney. Moreover, in novel {NC-BWR} designs the steam separation is performed in the steam separators which create large pressure drops at the chimney outlet, which effect on stability has not been investigated yet. In this work, flashing-induced oscillations occurring in a tall, bottom heated channel are numerically investigated by using a simple linear model with three regions and an accurate implementation for estimating the water properties. The model is used to investigate flashing-induced instabilities in a channel for different values of the core inlet friction value. The results are compared with experiments obtained by using the {CIRCUS} facility at the same conditions, showing a good agreement. In addition, the experiments on flashing-induced instabilities are presented in a novel manner allowing visualizing new details of the phenomenon numerical stability investigations on the effect of the friction distribution are also done. It is found that by increasing the total restriction in the channel the system is destabilized. In addition, the chimney outlet restriction has a stronger destabilizing effect than the core inlet restriction. A stable two-phase region is observed prior to the instabilities in the experiments and the numerical simulations which may help to pressurize the vessel of {NC-BWRs} and thus reducing the effects of flashing instabilities during start-up.},

Eight parallel silicon microchannels, with an identical trapezoidal cross-section having a hydraulic diameter of 186 μm and a length of 30 mm, were used in this experiment. When the wall heat flux was increased from 13.5 to 22.6 W/cm2 and the time average mass flux of water was decreased from 14.6 to 11.2 g/cm2 s, three kinds of unstable boiling modes were observed in the microchannels. These were (1) the liquid/two-phase alternating flow {(LTAF)} at low heat flux and high mass flux, (2) the continuous two-phase flow {(CTF)} at medium heat flux and medium mass flux, and (3) the liquid/two-phase/vapor alternating flow {(LTVAF)} at high heat flux and low mass flux. Simultaneously, periodic oscillations of wall temperature, inlet and outlet water temperatures and pressures, and instantaneous mass flux were measured. Among the three unstable boiling modes, oscillation amplitudes in {LTVAF} were the largest with oscillations of pressures and mass flux nearly out of phase. Oscillation amplitudes in {CTF} were the smallest with oscillations of pressures and mass flux nearly in phase. Oscillation amplitudes in {LTAF} lied in between {LTVAF} and {CTF} with oscillations of pressures and mass flux nearly out of phase. Also, the oscillation period (including two-phase period, liquid period and vapor period) depends greatly on the amounts of heat flux and mass flux. Bubbly flow and some peculiar two-phase flow patterns were observed in the microchannels during two-phase flow periods.},

These were: the liquid/two-phase alternating flow {(LTAF)} at two different heat fluxes, the continuous two-phase flow {(CTF)} at medium heat flux and medium mass flux, and the liquid/two-phase/vapor alternating flow {(LTVAF)} at high heat flux and low mass flux. In this paper, data of these unstable boiling cases are analyzed using the following methods: correlation coefficient, attractor reconstruction, correlation dimension and largest Lyapunov exponent. The processes responsible for appearance of chaotic oscillations in microchannels, such as nucleation, stability of bubbly flow, vapour core stability and vapour-phase flow stability, are discussed. It is shown that under certain conditions, the microchannels system works as a thermal oscillator. It was found that heat supplied to the microchannels increases the heating surface temperature while the appearance of the two-phase flow inside the channels decreases the heating surface temperature. The mechanism involving an increase in heating surface temperature is supported by phenomena of blocking the liquid flow in microchannels by the two-phase flow.},

	abstract = {The state-of-the-art of theoretical investigations on the flow oscillations that occur in a boiling natural circulation loop has been presented here. Motivation behind the work is to develop a high-fidelity model that is capable of predicting nature of flow instabilities more accurately. At the low pressures and low heat fluxes conditions, the major four types of instabilities may occur in boiling natural circulation loop depending on operating conditions: Flow excursion, Geysering instability, Flashing-induced instability and Type I density-wave oscillations. The characteristics of different instabilities as well as the effects of different operating and geometric parameters on them have been reviewed. The objective of this review is to gather the research findings on the nonlinear stability phenomena in various boiling flow channel systems over a period of several years. This review indicates that most of the theoretical predictions of amplitudes and periods of the sustained oscillations are carried out using two models, namely, homogeneous equilibrium model {(HEM)} (still debatable) and drift-flux model {(DFM)} (more realistic) and are validated by experimental findings. This review work on theoretical investigations presented in this paper indicates that there are enough scopes for improving mathematical formulations of the natural circulation boiling loop {(NCBL)} for thermohydraulic instabilities.},

	abstract = {Many advanced reactor designs incorporate passive systems mainly to enhance the operational safety and possible elimination of severe accident condition. Some reactors are even designed to remove the nominal fission heat passively by natural circulation without using mechanical pumps e.g. {ESBWR}, {AHWR}, {CHTR}, {CAREM}, etc. while in most other new reactor concepts, the decay heat is removed passively by natural circulation following the pump trip conditions. The design and safety analysis of these reactors are carried out using the best estimate codes such as {RELAP5}, {TRAC} and {CATHARE}, etc. These best estimate codes have been developed for pumped circulation systems and it is not proven about their adequacy or applicability for natural circulation systems wherein the driving mechanism is completely different. Some of the key phenomena which are difficult to model but are significantly important to assess the natural circulation system performances are – low flow natural circulation mainly because the flow is not fully developed and can be multi-dimensional in nature; flow instabilities; critical heat flux under oscillatory condition; flow stratification particularly in large diameter vessel; thermal stratification in large pools; effect of non-condensable gases on condensation, etc. Though, these best estimate codes use a six equation two-fluid model formulation for the thermal-hydraulic calculation which is considered to be the best representative of two-phase flows, but their accuracies depend on the accuracies of the models for interfacial relationships for mass, energy and momentum transfer which are semi-empirical in nature. The other problem with two-fluid models is the effect of ill-posedness which may cause numerical instability. Besides, the numerical diffusion associated due to truncation of higher order terms can affect the prediction of flow instabilities. All these effects may lead to inability to capture the important physical instability in natural circulation systems and instability characteristics i.e. amplitude and frequency of flow oscillation. In view of this, it is essential to test the capability of these codes to simulate natural circulation behavior under single and two-phase flow conditions before applying them to the future reactor concepts. In the present study, one of the extensively used best estimate code {RELAP5} has been used for simulation of steady state, transient and stability behavior of natural circulation based experimental facilities, such as the High-Pressure Natural Circulation Loop {(HPNCL)} and the Parallel Channel Loop {(PCL)} installed and operating at {BARC.} The test data have been generated for a range of pressure, power and subcooling conditions. The computer code {RELAP5/MOD3.2} was applied to predict the transient natural circulation characteristics under single-phase and two-phase conditions, thresholds of flow instability, amplitude and frequency of flow oscillations for different operating conditions of the loops. This paper presents the effect of nodalisation in prediction of natural circulation behavior in test facilities and a comparison of experimental data in with that of code predictions. The errors associated with the predictions are also characterized.},

In particular, some open literature, produced since the pioneering work of Welander {[J.} Fluid Mech. 29 (1967) 17–30] and related to single-phase thermosyphon loops, is firstly considered; then the analysis turns to summarize some early calculations and examples of code verification results dealing with the prediction of single-phase natural circulation. The work previously performed by the Authors in relation to Welander's problem and other relevant single-phase thermosyphon loop cases is reviewed, with main emphasis on the adopted methodology, based on numerical discretization of governing equations. These results serve to illustrate how time domain codes may be used to analyze such problems and also to highlight the effect of considering different constitutive laws in the computed linear stability map. Reference to the application of this methodology to boiling channel stability analysis is also made to demonstrate its generality. The results show both the qualitative and quantitative details of the changes that stability maps undergo as a consequence of numerical discretization of governing equations. The recent attempt to make easier the application of the methodology by the use of automatic fortran code differentiation tools is finally reported, showing quantitative results concerning calculation of the sensitivity of simulation results to physical and numerical parameters.},

Most of the documented instabilities are either of the “surge” type which are driven by inertial effects or changes in flow regimes (this includes quench-dryout instabilities and condensation driven “chugging”), or they depend on loop wide feedback effects and consequently have a frequency proportional to the fluid transit time (density wave). Although the observed dynamic behavior incorporates some features of both categories, it cannot be adequately described by these mechanisms. It is shown that the system response consists of two sequentially alternating, relatively stable flow phases, which have a source-sink imbalance of opposite sign. These flow phases can persist for lengthy periods of time (long in comparison to the fluid transit time). This is of importance because it implies that in analyzing the behavior of the system, time averaging methods cannot be used.},

Excellent results were obtained and a broad picture of the trends produced by the various parameters that affect instability is presented. This study concluded that, within the experimental range, the inlet temperature, heating power and the presence of the unheated bypass channel are the three most dominant factors affecting the loop instability. The Taguchi method is found to be very efficient and there is a great deal of saving in the experimental work. The 20 runs of experiment based on the Taguchi method suggests that the stability of the present two-phase natural circulation loop {(TPNCL)} would be improved under the following conditions: decreased inlet temperature, decreased thermal load, disconnected unheated bypass channel, installing the compressible volume with a higher water level in the downstream two-phase flow region, disconnected upstream compressible volume, increased single-phase flow restrictions, and decreased two-phase flow restrictions. Although the same trends bear the standard method of stabilizing a boiling channel, the restriction factors in the present experimental investigation are found to be ineffective in dampening the thermal–hydraulic instability.},

For the given operating range and loop geometry, the circulation velocity lies in the turbulent regime. The flow rate monotonically increases with the loop height. However, with heat flux it initially increases, reaches maximum and then falls. This implies that the surface heat flux should match the loop geometry and other operating parameters to produce the maximum flow rate.

The calculated steady-state results provide a reasonable agreement against the experimental data in the high power region but overestimate in the low power region under both equal-heating and unequal-heating conditions. Nonlinear dynamics and stability boundary of the double-channel boiling natural circulation loop are also analyzed. Two unstable regions, type-I and type-{II} instabilities, are found in this system. Complex channel-to-channel interactions coupling with loop dynamics may occur in the double-channel natural circulation loop. For the equal-heating system, out-of-phase oscillations may prevail under the operating conditions that the gravitational pressure drops are very highly dominant, such as low subcooling and low power conditions. However, in-phase oscillations may exist in the medium to high power regions, where two-phase frictions are relatively important. For the unequal-heating system, the heating power difference between two channels may drive the system more unstable both in type-I and type-{II} regions. The two unequal-heating channels exhibit in-phase oscillation mode, instead of out-of-phase in the equal-heating system, at low subcooling and low power conditions. In addition, parametric effects on the stability are also evaluated in this study.},

The available experimental apparatus is provided with a heat sink which can be feed with cooling fluid at controlled temperature. In this way the {NCL} mean temperature and heat flow rate can be varied independently. A set of {CFD} simulations with various heat sink temperatures, at fixed heat flow rate, has been carried out in order to improve the comprehension of the data collected during the experimental campaigns.},

In a multiple loop system, the characteristics of natural circulation are more complicated because of the interaction between the loops. In this study, the effects of the multiple loop on the natural circulation instability were investigated experimentally. As the simple multiple loop system, the toroidal loop with insulated connecting tube between both sides (θ-loop) was evaluated. The variation of flow regime in the θ-loop was almost the same as that in the single loop. However, the chaotic condition in an inclined θ-loop was narrower than that of inclined single loop. The flow and the pressure transfer in the connecting tube played an important role in the chaotic condition in the θ-loop.},

The paper outlines a general and consistent modeling method to describe two-phase natural circulation at steady state. The solution of the one-dimensional governing conservation equations is performed by a combination of analytical and numerical stages. The method is implicit, to treat the highly nonlinear problem by multinested iteration loops. Results are presented and discussed for the multiple solutions of the flow rate, temperature, quality and void distributions and two-phase elevations. Pressure effects are also studied. A comparison with available data shows that the theoretical model simulates the important characteristics of two-phase thermosyphons.},

	abstract = {Effect of the heater and cooler orientations on the single-phase natural circulation was studied in a rectangular loop. From steady state considerations, the maximum flow for a specified operating condition is achievable for the orientation with both the heater and the cooler horizontal. However, this orientation is found to be least stable and the orientation with both heater and cooler vertical is found to be most stable. Three oscillatory modes were observed in the experiments, two of which are observable only for certain heat addition paths. A hysteresis (conditionally stable) regime wherein stable or unstable flow can prevail depending on the operating procedure is also observed. Generalized steady state equation valid for all the orientations is possible whereas generalized stability equation is possible for a given orientation and flow direction. Steady state flow rate can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using the generalized equation. The stability map predicted by the generalized equation is found to be highly conservative in that its unstable zone is much larger than that observed in the experiments. Both the linear and the nonlinear stability analyses gave the same stability map for identical initial conditions. With nonlinear analysis, it was possible to reproduce the observed unstable oscillatory modes albeit at significantly different power levels. Also, the predicted limit cycles were significantly different in shape which is attributed to the multidimensional nature of the flow especially during the low flow part of the oscillation cycle.},

A simple, one-dimensional two-phase homogeneous equilibrium flow was assumed. Heat flux, inlet subcooling, inlet- and exit-line restrictions, condenser liquid level, loop height and the heater section length were taken as parameters. The results were summarized on the instability map in the plane of {Npch(Fr)12} vs. Nsub. The stable region appears at the lower left part of the map, bounded by two boundaries; the excursive instability region appears at the upper right part of the map. From the map, it can be readily confirmed that the dynamic stability criterion automatically satisfies the excursive stability criterion. Effects of parameters on the stability of the system were also discussed in this paper. The upper boundary of the stable region was compared with the experimental results reported previously.},

In quasi-steady state, the flow became relatively stabilized and certain regular patterns of flow oscillations were detected with ranges of periods in 8–35 s and 2.5–4 min. To explain the nature of these oscillations, a preliminary analysis with the general expression of the characteristic equation was introduced. The characteristic equation which is a function of the residence times in each flow region can be used to obtain the stability criteria. A simplified analytical approach showed that the short-period oscillations were representative of manometric oscillations, which can also be confirmed by simplifying the characteristic equation. The longer period oscillations infer the density wave oscillation which has the oscillatory period close to the residence time of a fluid around the loop.},

In particular, it is found that none of the existing higher order schemes for a staggered mesh system simultaneously conserve mass, momentum, and kinetic energy. This deficiency is corrected through the derivation of a general family of fully conservative higher order accurate finite difference schemes for staggered grid systems. Finite difference schemes in a collocated grid system are also analyzed, and a violation of kinetic energy conservation is revealed. The predicted conservation properties are demonstrated numerically in simulations of inviscid white noise, performed in a two-dimensional periodic domain. The proposed fourth order schemes in a staggered grid system are generalized for the case of a non-uniform mesh, and the resulting scheme is used to perform large eddy simulations of turbulent channel flow.},

These schemes can be used in conjunction with an appropriate spatial discretization scheme for the numerical solution of time dependent conservation equations. The main concept behind these schemes is that the order of accuracy in time is dropped locally in regions where the time evolution of the solution is not smooth. By doing this, an attempt is made at locally satisfying monotonicity conditions, while maintaining a high order of accuracy in most of the solution domain. When a linear high order time integration scheme is used along with a high order spatial discretization, enforcement of monotonicity imposes severe time-step restrictions. We propose to apply limiters to these time-integration schemes, thus making them non-linear. When these new schemes are used with high order spatial discretizations, solutions remain non-oscillatory for much larger time-steps as compared to linear time integration schemes. Numerical results obtained on scalar conservation equations and systems of conservation equations are highly promising.},

	abstract = {We present a new finite-difference numerical method to solve the incompressible {Navier–Stokes} equations using a collocated discretization in space on a logically Cartesian grid. The method shares some common aspects with, and it was inspired by, the Box scheme. It uses centered second-order-accurate finite-difference approximations for the spatial derivatives combined with semi-implicit time integration. The proposed method is constructed to ensure discrete conservation of mass and momentum by discretizing the primitive velocity–pressure form of the equations. The continuity equation is enforced exactly (to machine accuracy) at the collocated locations, whereas the momentum equations are evaluated in a staggered manner. This formulation preempts the appearance of spurious pressure modes in the embedded elliptic problem associated with the pressure. The method shows uniform order of accuracy, both in space and time, for velocity and pressure. In addition, the skew-symmetric form of the non-linear advection term of the {Navier–Stokes} equations improves discrete conservation of kinetic energy in the inviscid limit, to within the order of the truncation error of the time integrator. The method has been formulated to accommodate different types of boundary conditions; fully periodic, periodic channel, inflow-outflow and lid-driven cavity; always ensuring global mass conservation. A novel aspect of this finite-difference formulation is the derivation of the discretization near boundaries using the weak form of the equations, as in the finite element method. The method of manufactured solutions is utilized to perform accuracy analysis and verification of the solver. To assess the applicability of the new method presented in this paper, four realistic flow problems have been simulated and results are compared with those in the literature. These cases include a lid-driven cavity, backward-facing step, Kovasznay flow, and fully developed turbulent channel.},

This is the latest heat sink designed to ensure the cooling down of the vessel and other structural materials during an accident scenario. An experimental facility was built at Texas {A\&amp;M} to quantitatively analyze heat transfer phenomena and the air flow regime inside the reactor cavity. The thermal measurements were performed using 18 thermocouples mounted on the vessel surface, 8 on the external surface of one of the cooling pipes and 24 on a movable rack that captures the axial temperature profile inside the cavity. Flow regime measurements were performed with Particle Tracking Velocimetry techniques {(PTV)}, using a high speed camera and spraying a special dust in the cavity for the tracking. The results demonstrate that the main heat transfer mode inside the cavity is the radiation (about 80\%); also, they show the complexity of the flow regime inside the cavity due to natural circulation. The experimental conditions were a vessel surface temperature of about 300 {°C} heated at fixed power and different flow rates for the cooling pipes.},

	abstract = {A five-equation model for compressible two-fluid flow is proposed, that is based on physical flow equations only. The model is conservative and pressure-oscillation free. Equations for continuous flow and jump conditions for discontinuities are given, as well as a discretization of the equations and an adaptation of the {HLL} Riemann solver to two-fluid flow. Numerical tests in {1D} and {2D} show the accuracy of the method. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {We present a coupled level set/volume-of-fluid method for computing growth and collapse of vapor bubbles. The liquid is assumed incompressible and the vapor is assumed to have constant pressure in space. Second order algorithms are used for finding “mass conserving” extension velocities, for discretizing the local interfacial curvature and also for the discretization of the cell-centered projection step. Convergence studies are given that demonstrate this second order accuracy. Examples are provided that apply to cavitating bubbles.},
