  abstract = {We present a new finite-difference numerical method to solve the incompressible Navier\textendash{}Stokes equations using a collocated discretization in space on a logically Cartesian grid. The method shares some common aspects with, and it was inspired by, the Box scheme. It uses centered second-order-accurate finite-difference approximations for the spatial derivatives combined with semi-implicit time integration. The proposed method is constructed to ensure discrete conservation of mass and momentum by discretizing the primitive velocity\textendash{}pressure form of the equations. The continuity equation is enforced exactly (to machine accuracy) at the collocated locations, whereas the momentum equations are evaluated in a staggered manner. This formulation preempts the appearance of spurious pressure modes in the embedded elliptic problem associated with the pressure. The method shows uniform order of accuracy, both in space and time, for velocity and pressure. In addition, the skew-symmetric form of the non-linear advection term of the Navier\textendash{}Stokes equations improves discrete conservation of kinetic energy in the inviscid limit, to within the order of the truncation error of the time integrator. The method has been formulated to accommodate different types of boundary conditions; fully periodic, periodic channel, inflow-outflow and lid-driven cavity; always ensuring global mass conservation. A novel aspect of this finite-difference formulation is the derivation of the discretization near boundaries using the weak form of the equations, as in the finite element method. The method of manufactured solutions is utilized to perform accuracy analysis and verification of the solver. To assess the applicability of the new method presented in this paper, four realistic flow problems have been simulated and results are compared with those in the literature. These cases include a lid-driven cavity, backward-facing step, Kovasznay flow, and fully developed turbulent channel.},

  abstract = {The proposition of hyperbolic conduction (also known as the second sound wave) for materials with non-homogeneous inner structure has run into a serious controversy in recent times. While one group of investigators has observed very strong evidence of hyperbolic nature of conduction in such materials and experimentally determined the corresponding relaxation times to be of the order of tens of seconds, the other group proclaims that their experiments do not show any such relaxation behaviour and the conventional Fourier law of conduction is good enough to describe conduction in them. This paper is an effort towards resolving this controversy. In the first place the experimental philosophies and techniques of both the groups have been thoroughly examined. It has been observed that determination of thermophysical properties independent of the relaxation time measurement is an inherent inconsistency in all these experiments. Additionally the assumptions regarding temperature input might have also played a role to arrive at diverging conclusions. Based on these observations an experimental method has been suggested in this study which uses temperature oscillation in semi infinite medium to determine the thermal diffusivity and the relaxation time simultaneously from a single experiment. Using this technique the wide range of experiments conducted reveal that there exists a definite hyperbolic effect in the ``bulk'' conduction behaviour of such materials although it is somewhat less in extent to those reported by investigators claiming existence of hyperbolic conduction. Also a wide range of experiments with variation of parameters such as packing material, its particle size, filling gas used and its pressure and temperature have been conducted. The data presented here for the wide range of parameters can be useful for further investigations and plausible explanation of ``bulk conduction'' in materials with non-homogeneous inner structure.},

  abstract = {Flow excursion instability in an open two-phase natural circulation loop was studied both experimentally and analytically. At high inlet subcooling, stable mode (continuous circulation) does not exist; instead, three different circulation modes such as periodic circulation (A), multimode circulation, and periodic circulation (B) appear at different heat flux conditions. The multimode circulation is represented by the combination of periodic circulations A and B and it is termed here as ``periodic flow excursion''. The decrease in the inlet restriction and/or the increase in the exit restriction broadened the region of the flow excursion, and these aspects were summarized on the instability map of the heat flux vs. inlet subcooling. In addition, with the one-dimensional two-phase homogeneous equilibrium assumption, the region of flow excursion was obtained analytically, which fairly agrees with the experimental results.},

  abstract = {We study Krylov subspace methods for solving unsymmetric linear algebraic systems that minimize the norm of the residual at each step (minimal residual (MR) methods). MR methods are often formulated in terms of a sequence of least squares (LS) problems of increasing dimension. We present several basic identities and bounds for the LS residual. These results are interesting in the general context of solving LS problems. When applied to MR methods, they show that the size of the MR residual is strongly related to the conditioning of different bases of the same Krylov subspace. Using different bases is useful in theory because relating convergence to the characteristics of different bases offers new insight into the behavior of MR methods.Different bases also lead to different implementations which are mathematically equivalent but can differ numerically. Our theoretical results are used for a finite precision analysis of implementations of the GMRES method [Y. Saad and M. H. Schultz, SIAM J. Sci. Statist. Comput., 7 (1986), pp. 856--869]. We explain that the choice of the basis is fundamental for the numerical stability of the implementation. As demonstrated in the case of Simpler GMRES [H. F. Walker and L. Zhou, Numer. Linear Algebra Appl., 1 (1994), pp. 571--581], the best orthogonalization technique used for computing the basis does not compensate for the loss of accuracy due to an inappropriate choice of the basis. In particular, we prove that Simpler GMRES is inherently less numerically stable than the Classical GMRES implementation due to Saad and Schultz [SIAM J. Sci. Statist. Comput., 7 (1986), pp. 856--869].},

In this paper, geysering is investigated experimentally in twin parallel channels in both natural and forced circulations under various conditions of heat input, inlet subcooling and non-heated riser length from the upper end of the heated section to the outlet plenum. The relationship between flow reversal and the onset of geysering is studied in particular. It makes clear that geysering in parallel boiling channels in natural circulation is fundamentally identical to that in forced circulation. Next, the effects of a large bubble covering the entire flow cross section and subcooling in the outlet plenum upon the occurrence of geysering are clarified. Finally, differences in behavior of geysering in a single channel as compared with that in parallel channels are discussed.},

  abstract = {How oil undermines democracy, and our ability to address the environmental crisis.Oil is a curse, it is often said, that condemns the countries producing it to an existence defined by war, corruption and enormous inequality. Carbon Democracy tells a more complex story, arguing that no nation escapes the political consequences of our collective dependence on oil. It shapes the body politic both in regions such as the Middle East, which rely upon revenues from oil production, and in the places that have the greatest demand for energy.Timothy Mitchell begins with the history of coal power to tell a radical new story about the rise of democracy. Coal was a source of energy so open to disruption that oligarchies in the West became vulnerable for the first time to mass demands for democracy. In the mid-twentieth century, however, the development of cheap and abundant energy from oil, most notably from the Middle East, offered a means to reduce this vulnerability to democratic pressures. The abundance of oil made it possible for the first time in history to reorganize political life around the management of something now called "the economy" and the promise of its infinite growth. The politics of the West became dependent on an undemocratic Middle East.In the twenty-first century, the oil-based forms of modern democratic politics have become unsustainable. Foreign intervention and military rule are faltering in the Middle East, while governments everywhere appear incapable of addressing the crises that threaten to end the age of carbon democracy\textemdash{}the disappearance of cheap energy and the carbon-fuelled collapse of the ecological order.In making the production of energy the central force shaping the democratic age, Carbon Democracy rethinks the history of energy, the politics of nature, the theory of democracy, and the place of the Middle East in our common world.},

  abstract = {Fundamental Mechanics of Fluids, Fourth Edition addresses the need for an introductory text that focuses on the basics of fluid mechanics\textemdash{}before concentrating on specialized areas such as ideal-fluid flow and boundary-layer theory. Filling that void for both students and professionals working in different branches of engineering, this versatile instructional resource comprises five flexible, self-contained sections:  Governing Equations deals with the derivation of the basic conservation laws, flow kinematics, and some basic theorems of fluid mechanics.  Ideal-Fluid Flow covers two- and three-dimensional potential flows and surface waves.  Viscous Flows of Incompressible Fluids discusses exact solutions, low-Reynolds-number approximations, boundary-layer theory, and buoyancy-driven flows.  Compressible Flow of Inviscid Fluids addresses shockwaves as well as one- and multidimensional flows.  Methods of Mathematical Analysis summarizes some commonly used analysis techniques. Additional appendices offer a synopsis of vectors, tensors, Fourier series, thermodynamics, and the governing equations in the common coordinate systems. The book identifies the phenomena associated with the various properties of compressible, viscous fluids in unsteady, three-dimensional flow situations. It provides techniques for solving specific types of fluid-flow problems, and it covers the derivation of the basic equations governing the laminar flow of Newtonian fluids, first assessing general situations and then shifting focus to more specific scenarios.  The author illustrates the process of finding solutions to the governing equations. In the process, he reveals both the mathematical methodology and physical phenomena involved in each category of flow situation, which include ideal, viscous, and compressible fluids. This categorization enables a clear explanation of the different solution methods and the basis for the various physical consequences of fluid properties and flow characteristics. Armed with this new understanding, readers can then apply the appropriate equation results to deal with the particular circumstances of their own work.},

In this study, the effects of the multiple loop on the natural circulation instability were investigated experimentally. As the simple multiple loop system, the toroidal loop with insulated connecting tube between both sides (\texttheta-loop) was evaluated. The variation of flow regime in the \texttheta-loop was almost the same as that in the single loop. However, the chaotic condition in an inclined \texttheta-loop was narrower than that of inclined single loop. The flow and the pressure transfer in the connecting tube played an important role in the chaotic condition in the \texttheta-loop.},

Two main approaches are compared: one that computes the approximate solution in terms of a Krylov space basis from an upper triangular linear system for the coordinates, and one where the approximate solutions are updated with a simple recursion formula. We show that a different choice of the basis can significantly influence the numerical behavior of the resulting implementation. While Simpler GMRES and ORTHODIR are less stable due to the ill-conditioning of the basis used, the residual basis is well-conditioned as long as we have a reasonable residual norm decrease. These results lead to a new implementation, which is conditionally backward stable, and they explain the experimentally observed fact that the GCR method delivers very accurate approximate solutions when it converges fast enough without stagnation.},

This is the latest heat sink designed to ensure the cooling down of the vessel and other structural materials during an accident scenario. An experimental facility was built at Texas A\&amp;M to quantitatively analyze heat transfer phenomena and the air flow regime inside the reactor cavity. The thermal measurements were performed using 18 thermocouples mounted on the vessel surface, 8 on the external surface of one of the cooling pipes and 24 on a movable rack that captures the axial temperature profile inside the cavity. Flow regime measurements were performed with Particle Tracking Velocimetry techniques (PTV), using a high speed camera and spraying a special dust in the cavity for the tracking. The results demonstrate that the main heat transfer mode inside the cavity is the radiation (about 80\%); also, they show the complexity of the flow regime inside the cavity due to natural circulation. The experimental conditions were a vessel surface temperature of about 300 $^\circ$C heated at fixed power and different flow rates for the cooling pipes.},

  abstract = {Jacobian-free Newton\textendash{}Krylov (JFNK) methods are synergistic combinations of Newton-type methods for superlinearly convergent solution of nonlinear equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the Newton correction equations. The link between the two methods is the Jacobian-vector product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means. Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear problems, successful application of the JFNK method to any given problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. JFNK has potential for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations and integro-differential equations. In this survey paper, we place JFNK in context with other nonlinear solution algorithms for both boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value problems (IVPs). We provide an overview of the mechanics of JFNK and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options available. It is emphasized that JFNK can be wrapped (as an accelerator) around another nonlinear fixed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially with significant code reuse). The aim of this paper is not to trace fully the evolution of JFNK, nor to provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how JFNK may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide sources of further practical information.},

In order to experimentally investigate the stability of supercritical reactors, a fluid-to-fluid downscaled facility is proposed. It is found that with an appropriate mixture of refrigerants R-125 and R-32, the dimensionless enthalpy and density of the supercritical water can be accurately matched for all relevant operational conditions of the reactor. Moreover, the inertia distribution, the friction factor distribution and the heat transfer mechanism are taken into account in the modeling. As a result of the proposed downscaling, the operational pressure, temperature and power are considerably smaller than those of a water-based system, which in turn helps reducing the construction and operational costs of a test facility. Finally, it is found that the often used modeling fluid supercritical CO2 cannot accurately represent supercritical water at reactor conditions.},

Criteria for the excursive and the density wave instability were obtained from the steady loopwise momentum equation and the characteristic equation, respectively. A simple, one-dimensional two-phase homogeneous equilibrium flow was assumed. Heat flux, inlet subcooling, inlet- and exit-line restrictions, condenser liquid level, loop height and the heater section length were taken as parameters. The results were summarized on the instability map in the plane of Npch(Fr)12 vs. Nsub. The stable region appears at the lower left part of the map, bounded by two boundaries; the excursive instability region appears at the upper right part of the map. From the map, it can be readily confirmed that the dynamic stability criterion automatically satisfies the excursive stability criterion. Effects of parameters on the stability of the system were also discussed in this paper. The upper boundary of the stable region was compared with the experimental results reported previously.},

Excellent results were obtained and a broad picture of the trends produced by the various parameters that affect instability is presented. This study concluded that, within the experimental range, the inlet temperature, heating power and the presence of the unheated bypass channel are the three most dominant factors affecting the loop instability. The Taguchi method is found to be very efficient and there is a great deal of saving in the experimental work. The 20 runs of experiment based on the Taguchi method suggests that the stability of the present two-phase natural circulation loop (TPNCL) would be improved under the following conditions: decreased inlet temperature, decreased thermal load, disconnected unheated bypass channel, installing the compressible volume with a higher water level in the downstream two-phase flow region, disconnected upstream compressible volume, increased single-phase flow restrictions, and decreased two-phase flow restrictions. Although the same trends bear the standard method of stabilizing a boiling channel, the restriction factors in the present experimental investigation are found to be ineffective in dampening the thermal\textendash{}hydraulic instability.},

Experimental results indicate that the characteristics of the thermal hydraulic oscillations can be periodic, with 2\textendash{}5 fundamental frequencies, or chaotic, depending on the heating power and inlet subcooling. The number of fundamental frequencies of oscillation increases if the inlet subcooling is increased at a given heating power or the heating power is decreased at a given inlet subcooling; chaotic oscillations appear if the inlet subcooling is further increased and/or the heating power is further decreased. A map of the oscillation characteristics is thus established. The change in oscillation characteristics is evident from the time evolution and power spectrum of a thermal hydraulic parameter and the phase portraits of two thermal hydraulic parameters. These results reveal that a strange attractor exists in a low pressure two-phase natural circulation loop with low power and very high inlet subcooling.},

  abstract = {Many advanced reactor designs incorporate passive systems mainly to enhance the operational safety and possible elimination of severe accident condition. Some reactors are even designed to remove the nominal fission heat passively by natural circulation without using mechanical pumps e.g. ESBWR, AHWR, CHTR, CAREM, etc. while in most other new reactor concepts, the decay heat is removed passively by natural circulation following the pump trip conditions. The design and safety analysis of these reactors are carried out using the best estimate codes such as RELAP5, TRAC and CATHARE, etc. These best estimate codes have been developed for pumped circulation systems and it is not proven about their adequacy or applicability for natural circulation systems wherein the driving mechanism is completely different. Some of the key phenomena which are difficult to model but are significantly important to assess the natural circulation system performances are \textendash{} low flow natural circulation mainly because the flow is not fully developed and can be multi-dimensional in nature; flow instabilities; critical heat flux under oscillatory condition; flow stratification particularly in large diameter vessel; thermal stratification in large pools; effect of non-condensable gases on condensation, etc. Though, these best estimate codes use a six equation two-fluid model formulation for the thermal-hydraulic calculation which is considered to be the best representative of two-phase flows, but their accuracies depend on the accuracies of the models for interfacial relationships for mass, energy and momentum transfer which are semi-empirical in nature. The other problem with two-fluid models is the effect of ill-posedness which may cause numerical instability. Besides, the numerical diffusion associated due to truncation of higher order terms can affect the prediction of flow instabilities. All these effects may lead to inability to capture the important physical instability in natural circulation systems and instability characteristics i.e. amplitude and frequency of flow oscillation. In view of this, it is essential to test the capability of these codes to simulate natural circulation behavior under single and two-phase flow conditions before applying them to the future reactor concepts. In the present study, one of the extensively used best estimate code RELAP5 has been used for simulation of steady state, transient and stability behavior of natural circulation based experimental facilities, such as the High-Pressure Natural Circulation Loop (HPNCL) and the Parallel Channel Loop (PCL) installed and operating at BARC. The test data have been generated for a range of pressure, power and subcooling conditions. The computer code RELAP5/MOD3.2 was applied to predict the transient natural circulation characteristics under single-phase and two-phase conditions, thresholds of flow instability, amplitude and frequency of flow oscillations for different operating conditions of the loops. This paper presents the effect of nodalisation in prediction of natural circulation behavior in test facilities and a comparison of experimental data in with that of code predictions. The errors associated with the predictions are also characterized.},

  abstract = {Theoretical investigations were carried out to study the influence of two-phase flow parameters such as friction factor multiplier, drift velocity and void distribution parameter on the stability of boiling two-phase natural circulation systems. The theoretical model considers a four-equation drift flux model which solves the linearised conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy applicable to boiling two-phase natural circulation systems. The model was applied to three boiling natural circulation loops wherein Type I and Type II instabilities were observed over a wide range of operating pressures. The two-phase friction loss was predicted using different friction factor multiplier models available in literature. It was found that these models influence the steady state and threshold powers for stability, especially the Type II instabilities in natural circulation significantly. Since the void fraction depends on the drift velocity and the void distribution parameter in two-phase flow, these parameters were varied and their effects on the natural circulation flow stability were investigated. It was found that an increase in either the drift velocity or the void distribution parameter reduces the unstable regions observed in the Type I or Type II flow instabilities in two-phase natural circulation systems. Further, investigations were carried out to study the effect of loop diameter on the Type I and Type II instabilities in natural circulation. This study is important to reveal the capability of the reduced diameter scaled facilities of the prototype systems to simulate natural circulation instabilities. The results indicate that with increase in the loop diameter, the threshold power of the Type I instability and the Type II instability increases. Moreover, the stability of natural circulation greatly enhances with increase in the diameter of the loop.},

One of the main features of the proposed approaches is that one can develop multi-point derivative-free methods of any desired order. For lower order methods, these correspond to the Newton, and Ostrowski iterations.

In a double loop system, the observed flow was classified into five regimes, namely, steady, transient\textendash{}CS, transient\textendash{}CS$\zhide$CL, transient\textendash{}CL and complex chaotic regimes, which were more complicated than those observed in single loop system. The flow regimes were qualitatively explained by the stability of the attractor in the phase space. The complexity of the regime was caused by the coexistence of two attractors.},

  abstract = {The state-of-the-art of theoretical investigations on the flow oscillations that occur in a boiling natural circulation loop has been presented here. Motivation behind the work is to develop a high-fidelity model that is capable of predicting nature of flow instabilities more accurately. At the low pressures and low heat fluxes conditions, the major four types of instabilities may occur in boiling natural circulation loop depending on operating conditions: Flow excursion, Geysering instability, Flashing-induced instability and Type I density-wave oscillations. The characteristics of different instabilities as well as the effects of different operating and geometric parameters on them have been reviewed. The objective of this review is to gather the research findings on the nonlinear stability phenomena in various boiling flow channel systems over a period of several years. This review indicates that most of the theoretical predictions of amplitudes and periods of the sustained oscillations are carried out using two models, namely, homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM) (still debatable) and drift-flux model (DFM) (more realistic) and are validated by experimental findings. This review work on theoretical investigations presented in this paper indicates that there are enough scopes for improving mathematical formulations of the natural circulation boiling loop (NCBL) for thermohydraulic instabilities.},

A preliminary validation of the analytical model has been carried out by using an independent program developed for the analysis of stability in natural circulation loops. The aim of the present work is to provide a simple analytical tool devoted to the stability analysis of a reference single-phase loop. This model can be applied in a relatively wide range of conditions and regimes to provide benchmark solutions for thermal-hydraulic codes and related nodalisations.},

  abstract = {In order to study the two-phase natural circulation and flow termination during a small break loss of coolant accident in LWR, a hot leg U-bend simulation loop has been built based on the two-phase flow scaling criteria developed under this program. The nitrogen-water system has been used to isolate the key hydrodynamic phenomena from heat transfer problems. Various tests were carried out to establish the basic mechanism of the flow termination and reestablishment as well as to obtain essential information on scale effects of various parameters such as the loop frictional resistance, thermal center, U-bend curvature, and inlet geometry. It was found that the permanent termination of the natural circulation was related to the head balance between the hot and cold legs. The local flow condition at the inverted U-bend could produce intermittent flow, however was not related to the permanent flow termination. The void distribution in a hot leg, flow regime, and natural circulation rate have been measured in detail for various conditions. Significant effects of the inlet geometry on these were observed. Near the flow termination condition, large amplitude flow oscillations occurred. The occurrence of this type of flow instability is important for safety analyses, because it may lead to loop-to-loop oscillations or flow excursions in a prototype system which has a multi-loop configuration.},

The motivation for this theoretical research is the concern about the stability of natural circulation BWRs during the low-pressure reactor start-up phase. There is experimental and theoretical evidence for the occurrence of void ?ashing in the unheated riser under these conditions. This ?ashing effect is included in the differential (homogeneous equilibrium) equations for two-phase ?ow. The differential equations were integrated over axial two-phase nodes, to derive a nodal time-domain model. The dynamic behavior of the interface between the one an two-phase regions is approximated with a linearized model. All model equations are presented in a dimensionless form. As an example the stability characteristics of the Dutch Dodewaard reactor at low pressure are determined.},

In contrast to the case without heat generation where up to three solutions exist, a large number of solutions may emerge arranged in a nested series of cusp points and isolas as the internal heat generation rate increases. The increased number of multiplicities imposes a number of both monotonic and non-monotonic temperature distributions along the fin height and reversal of the heat flow is observed at certain operating conditions. The fin profile has a profound effect on the solution by either increasing or decreasing the number of the singular points depending on whether a cylindrical or a trapezoidal profile is utilized. A generalized and smooth boiling heat transfer coefficient has been adopted so the results are not restricted to a particular working fluid.},

  abstract = {How oil undermines democracy, and our ability to address the environmental crisis.Oil is a curse, it is often said, that condemns the countries producing it to an existence defined by war, corruption and enormous inequality. Carbon Democracy tells a more complex story, arguing that no nation escapes the political consequences of our collective dependence on oil. It shapes the body politic both in regions such as the Middle East, which rely upon revenues from oil production, and in the places that have the greatest demand for energy.Timothy Mitchell begins with the history of coal power to tell a radical new story about the rise of democracy. Coal was a source of energy so open to disruption that oligarchies in the West became vulnerable for the first time to mass demands for democracy. In the mid-twentieth century, however, the development of cheap and abundant energy from oil, most notably from the Middle East, offered a means to reduce this vulnerability to democratic pressures. The abundance of oil made it possible for the first time in history to reorganize political life around the management of something now called "the economy" and the promise of its infinite growth. The politics of the West became dependent on an undemocratic Middle East.In the twenty-first century, the oil-based forms of modern democratic politics have become unsustainable. Foreign intervention and military rule are faltering in the Middle East, while governments everywhere appear incapable of addressing the crises that threaten to end the age of carbon democracy\textemdash{}the disappearance of cheap energy and the carbon-fuelled collapse of the ecological order.In making the production of energy the central force shaping the democratic age, Carbon Democracy rethinks the history of energy, the politics of nature, the theory of democracy, and the place of the Middle East in our common world.},

Existing finite difference schemes in regular and staggered grid systems are checked for violations of the conservation requirements and a few important discrepancies are pointed out. In particular, it is found that none of the existing higher order schemes for a staggered mesh system simultaneously conserve mass, momentum, and kinetic energy. This deficiency is corrected through the derivation of a general family of fully conservative higher order accurate finite difference schemes for staggered grid systems. Finite difference schemes in a collocated grid system are also analyzed, and a violation of kinetic energy conservation is revealed. The predicted conservation properties are demonstrated numerically in simulations of inviscid white noise, performed in a two-dimensional periodic domain. The proposed fourth order schemes in a staggered grid system are generalized for the case of a non-uniform mesh, and the resulting scheme is used to perform large eddy simulations of turbulent channel flow.},

  abstract = {This paper presents results on the stability of a simple heated channel containing fluids at supercritical pressure with an external imposed pressure drop. Basing on a recent work that discussed stability characteristics in a fluid-to-fluid comparison perspective, additional data are presented in order to discuss relevant parametric effects, also including a more accurate fluid-to-fluid comparison.

Three different analysis tools, including a system code and in-house linear and transient analysis programs, were adopted to evaluate stability thresholds at different channel throttling conditions and orientations; four different supercritical fluids were considered. The diversity of the adopted tools and the good level of agreement observed in the comparison of their results provide adequate confidence on the general reliability of the obtained information.

Among the addressed phenomena, both Ledinegg and density-wave oscillations are considered, pointing out a fundamental continuity between the two phenomena that occur in adjoining regions of the parameter space. Numerical effects are also highlighted, quantifying the impact of truncation error occurring in the use of system codes in the analysis of flow instabilities. The results obtained by different fluids provide further support to the conclusion that, when an appropriate dimensionless formalism is used, the differences obtained in the stability behaviour at imposed heat flux are relatively small for a number of fluids of interest for experimental analyses.},

  abstract = {The heat transport capability of natural circulation loops is directly proportional to the flow rate it can generate. Therefore, reliable prediction of flow rate is essential for design and performance evaluation of natural circulation loops. The reported generalized flow equation applicable for single-phase natural circulation is only valid for cases where the entire loop follows a single friction law. Such a situation arises when the natural circulation loop is either fully laminar or fully turbulent. It is possible that a natural circulation loop can be partly laminar and partly in transition or turbulent flow. In such cases, a single friction law is not applicable throughout the loop. In the present study, a generalized flow equation is proposed for cases where a single friction law is not applicable for the entire loop. The proposed equation is tested with experimental data generated in a uniform diameter rectangular loop and is found to be in good agreement. Subsequently the equation is tested with data reported in the literature. Stability analysis reported in literature for single-phase loops are either for laminar or turbulent flows. In practice, in natural circulation loops, all the flow regimes like laminar, transition and turbulent are observed. Therefore, it is required to develop a stability map, which is valid for all the three regions. In the present paper, such a stability map is presented.},

In particular, some open literature, produced since the pioneering work of Welander [J.

The work previously performed by the Authors in relation to Welander's problem and other relevant single-phase thermosyphon loop cases is reviewed, with main emphasis on the adopted methodology, based on numerical discretization of governing equations. These results serve to illustrate how time domain codes may be used to analyze such problems and also to highlight the effect of considering different constitutive laws in the computed linear stability map. Reference to the application of this methodology to boiling channel stability analysis is also made to demonstrate its generality. The results show both the qualitative and quantitative details of the changes that stability maps undergo as a consequence of numerical discretization of governing equations. The recent attempt to make easier the application of the methodology by the use of automatic fortran code differentiation tools is finally reported, showing quantitative results concerning calculation of the sensitivity of simulation results to physical and numerical parameters.},

The method is applied to a loop consisting of two vertical branches with a point heat source and sink. The system is represented by a one dimensional model, with the only space coordinate running along the loop. Integral forms of the momentum and energy equations are derived and solved to yield the flow rate and temperatures as functions of the time.

  abstract = {This paper develops and investigates iterative tensor methods for solving large-scale systems of nonlinear equations. Direct tensor methods for nonlinear equations have performed especially well on small, dense problems where the Jacobian matrix at the solution is singular or ill-conditioned, which may occur when approaching turning points, for example. This research extends direct tensor methods to large-scale problems by developing three tensor-Krylov methods that base each iteration upon a linear model augmented with a limited second-order term, which provides information lacking in a (nearly) singular Jacobian. The advantage of the new tensor-Krylov methods over existing large-scale tensor methods is their ability to solve the local tensor model to a specified accuracy, which produces a more accurate tensor step. The performance of these methods in comparison to Newton-GMRES and tensor-GMRES is explored on three Navier-Stokes fluid flow problems. The numerical results provide evidence that tensor-Krylov methods are generally more robust and more efficient than Newton-GMRES on some important and difficult problems. In addition, the results show that the new tensor-Krylov methods and tensor-GMRES each perform better in certain situations.},

The objective of this review is to sum up the experimental and theoretical work carried out by various investigators over a period of several years, demonstrating and explaining three main instability modes of two-phase flow dynamic instabilities, namely, density-wave type, pressure-drop type and thermal oscillations, encountered in various boiling flow channel systems. The typical experimental investigations of these instabilities in tube boiling systems are indicated and the most popular models to predict the two-phase flow dynamic instabilities, namely the homogenous flow model and the drift-flux models are clarified with the solution examples and the validation of the model results with experimental findings are also provided.},

  abstract = {A new class of implicit high-order non-oscillatory time integration schemes is introduced in a method-of-lines framework. These schemes can be used in conjunction with an appropriate spatial discretization scheme for the numerical solution of time dependent conservation equations. The main concept behind these schemes is that the order of accuracy in time is dropped locally in regions where the time evolution of the solution is not smooth. By doing this, an attempt is made at locally satisfying monotonicity conditions, while maintaining a high order of accuracy in most of the solution domain. When a linear high order time integration scheme is used along with a high order spatial discretization, enforcement of monotonicity imposes severe time-step restrictions. We propose to apply limiters to these time-integration schemes, thus making them non-linear. When these new schemes are used with high order spatial discretizations, solutions remain non-oscillatory for much larger time-steps as compared to linear time integration schemes. Numerical results obtained on scalar conservation equations and systems of conservation equations are highly promising.},

  abstract = {During the start-up phase, natural circulation BWRs (NC-BWRs) need to be operated at low pressure conditions. Such conditions favor flashing-induced instabilities due to the large hydrostatic pressure drop induced by the tall chimney. Moreover, in novel NC-BWR designs the steam separation is performed in the steam separators which create large pressure drops at the chimney outlet, which effect on stability has not been investigated yet. In this work, flashing-induced oscillations occurring in a tall, bottom heated channel are numerically investigated by using a simple linear model with three regions and an accurate implementation for estimating the water properties. The model is used to investigate flashing-induced instabilities in a channel for different values of the core inlet friction value. The results are compared with experiments obtained by using the CIRCUS facility at the same conditions, showing a good agreement. In addition, the experiments on flashing-induced instabilities are presented in a novel manner allowing visualizing new details of the phenomenon numerical stability investigations on the effect of the friction distribution are also done. It is found that by increasing the total restriction in the channel the system is destabilized. In addition, the chimney outlet restriction has a stronger destabilizing effect than the core inlet restriction. A stable two-phase region is observed prior to the instabilities in the experiments and the numerical simulations which may help to pressurize the vessel of NC-BWRs and thus reducing the effects of flashing instabilities during start-up.},

The natural circulation BWR is one such proposal. In this paper, advantages and disadvantages of the natural circulation BWR are considered from the requirements for next generation LWRs as compared with current BWRs. It is pointed out from this consideration that a thermo-hydraulic instability, which may appear during start-up, greatly influences concept feasibility because its occurrence makes operation for raising power output difficult. Thermo-hydraulic instabilities are investigated experimentally under conditions simulating normal and abnormal start-up processes. It is clarified that three kinds of thermo-hydraulic instabilities may occur during start-up in the natural circulation BWR according to its procedure and reactor configuration, which are (1) geysering induced by condensation, (2) natural circulation instability induced by hydrostatic head fluctuation in steam separators and (3) density wave instability. Driving mechanisms of the geysering and the natural circulation instability, which have never understood enough, are inferred from the results. Finally, the difference of thermo-hydraulic behavior during start-up processes between thermal natural circulation boilers and the Dodewaard reactor is discussed.},

These were: the liquid/two-phase alternating flow (LTAF) at two different heat fluxes, the continuous two-phase flow (CTF) at medium heat flux and medium mass flux, and the liquid/two-phase/vapor alternating flow (LTVAF) at high heat flux and low mass flux. In this paper, data of these unstable boiling cases are analyzed using the following methods: correlation coefficient, attractor reconstruction, correlation dimension and largest Lyapunov exponent. The processes responsible for appearance of chaotic oscillations in microchannels, such as nucleation, stability of bubbly flow, vapour core stability and vapour-phase flow stability, are discussed. It is shown that under certain conditions, the microchannels system works as a thermal oscillator. It was found that heat supplied to the microchannels increases the heating surface temperature while the appearance of the two-phase flow inside the channels decreases the heating surface temperature. The mechanism involving an increase in heating surface temperature is supported by phenomena of blocking the liquid flow in microchannels by the two-phase flow.},

Its purpose is to show, via algorithms in pseudocode, in MATLAB\textregistered, and with several examples, how one can choose an appropriate Newton-type method for a given problem and write an efficient solver or apply one written by others. This book is intended to complement my larger book [42], which focuses on indepth treatment of convergence theory, but does not discuss the details of solving particular problems, implementation in any particular language, or evaluating a solver for a given problem. The computational examples in this book were done with MATLAB v6.5 on an Apple Macintosh G4 and a SONY VAIO. The MATLAB codes for the solvers and all the examples accompany this book. MATLAB is an excellent environment for prototyping and testing and for moderate-sized production work. I have used the three main solvers nsold.m, nsoli.m, and brsola.m from the collection of MATLAB codes in my own research. The codes were designed for production work on small- to medium-scale problems having at most a few thousand unknowns. Large-scale problems are best done in a compiled language with a high-quality public domain code. We assume that the reader has a good understanding of elementary numerical analysis at the level of [4] and of numerical linear algebra at the level of [23, 76]. Because the examples are so closely coupled to the text, this book cannot be understood without a working knowledge of MATLAB. There are many introductory books on MATLAB. Either of [71] and [37] would be a good place to start.

  abstract = {The paper presents a methodology for the analysis of the flow stability in natural circulation loops containing fluids at supercritical pressure.

The work was made possible by the availability of experimental data collected on an experimental apparatus at the China Institute for Atomic Energy, showing the onset of unstable behaviour. The RELAP5 code is firstly used for predicting the observed phenomena, obtaining a qualitative prediction of instabilities with quantitative discrepancies in relation to the conditions observed for the onset of unstable behaviour.

In the aim to allow for a systematic discussion of stability phenomena, dimensionless parameters previously proposed to analyse the stability of single heated channels with fluids at supercritical pressures are now adapted and applied to natural circulation loops. The proposed dimensionless numbers address purely thermal\textendash{}hydraulic phenomena, disregarding the presence of heating structures. The combined analyses with the system code and an in-house code written in dimensionless form and based on the mentioned parameters allowed highlighting the importance of heat transfer to heating structures as a phenomenon contributing to stabilise natural circulation loops.},

The novel manner of visualizing the results allowed characterizing the facility at any time and position which helped to thoroughly understand the instability mechanisms. Different modes were observed for each configuration. In the case of having two-parallel channels, four different behaviors have been observed: stable flow circulation, periodic high subcooling oscillations, a-periodical oscillations and out-of-phase periodical oscillations. In addition, stability maps were constructed in order to clarify the region in which each mode is dominant. The results obtained from both the one and two-parallel channels configurations are thus analyzed and compared. As a result, some similarities have been observed between the intermittent flow oscillations found in the single channel experiments and the high subcooling oscillations found in the two-parallel channels experiments. Moreover, similarities have also been found between the sinusoidal flow oscillations existing in the single channel experiments and the out-of-phase oscillations from the two-parallel channels experiments. The experiments presented in this work can be used to benchmark numerical codes and modeling techniques developed to study the start-up of natural circulation BWRs.},

An in-house program, capable of linear and non-linear stability analysis of one-dimensional loops, with arbitrary configurations of heat sources and sinks, and a transient thermal\textendash{}hydraulics system code were adopted for the purpose of highlighting capabilities and limitations of one-dimensional models in predicting the involved phenomena. Both linear stability maps and transient flow evolutions have been calculated by the programs, obtaining information on both the linear and the non-linear dynamic behaviour of the addressed system, as predicted by one-dimensional, cross-section averaged balance equations. A computational fluid-dynamics code has been also adopted for simulating the system dynamics in the different loop configurations. In particular, the CFD code was effective in showing the origin of pulsating instabilities observed with horizontal heater and cooler, which could in no way be predicted by the one-dimensional models.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jcp.2005.11.009},
  abstract = {The collocated-mesh scheme is often favored over the staggered-mesh scheme for turbulence simulation in complex geometries due to its simpler form in curvilinear coordinates. The collocated mesh scheme does not conserve kinetic energy however, and few careful checks of the impact of these errors have been made. In this work, analysis is used to identify two sources of kinetic energy conservation error in the collocated-mesh scheme: (1) errors arising from the interpolations used to estimate the velocity on the cell faces, and (2) errors associated with the slightly inconsistent pressure field used to ensure mass conservation for the cell face volume fluxes. It is shown that the interpolation error can be eliminated through the use of first-order accurate centered interpolation operators with mesh-independent weights. The pressure error appears to be intrinsic to the scheme and it is shown to scale as O($\Delta$t2$\Delta$x2). The effects of the conservation errors are investigated numerically through simulations of inviscid flow over an airfoil and in large eddy simulations of turbulent channel flow. Neither the interpolation error nor the pressure error appear to lead to significant problems in the channel flow simulations where viscous dissipation is present and where the Cartesian mesh is stretched in only one direction. The inviscid airfoil simulations performed on a curvilinear mesh show a much greater sensitivity to the interpolation error. The standard second-order centered interpolation is shown to lead to severe numerical oscillations, while the kinetic energy-conserving first-order centered interpolation produces solutions that are almost as smooth as those obtained with a third-order upwind interpolation. When compared in channel flow simulations, however, the first-order centered interpolation is shown to be far superior to the third-order upwind interpolation, the latter being adversely affected by numerical dissipation. Only slight differences were noted when comparing channel flow simulations using first-order and second-order centered interpolations. These results suggest that numerical oscillations can be controlled in curvilinear coordinates through the use of properly-constructed non-dissipative centered interpolations.},

The effect of inlet subcooling and heating flux on the system instability is simulated under the system pressure Psys = 1.5 MPa. The numerical results show that there exist two instability inlet subcooling boundaries at different heat flux. The numerical results show good agreement with the experimental results on HRTL-5 without consideration of point neutron kinetics. If coupled with point neutron kinetics, the system will exhibit little difference on instability boundaries from that without considering the nuclear characteristics.

  abstract = {Supercritical water (SCW) has excellent heat transfer characteristics as a coolant for nuclear reactors. Besides it results in high thermal efficiency of the plant. However, the flow can experience instabilities in supercritical water reactors, as the density change is very large for the supercritical fluids. A computer code SUCLIN using supercritical water properties has been developed to carry out the steady state and linear stability analysis of a SCW natural circulation loop. The conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy have been linearized by imposing small perturbation in flow rate, enthalpy, pressure and specific volume. The equations have been solved analytically to generate the characteristic equation. The roots of the equation determine the stability of the system. The code has been qualitatively assessed with published results and has been extensively used for studying the effect of diameter, height, heater inlet temperature, pressure and local loss coefficients on steady state and stability behavior of a Supercritical Water Natural Circulation Loop (SCWNCL). The present paper describes the linear stability analysis model and the results obtained in detail.},

  abstract = {Effect of the heater and cooler orientations on the single-phase natural circulation was studied in a rectangular loop. From steady state considerations, the maximum flow for a specified operating condition is achievable for the orientation with both the heater and the cooler horizontal. However, this orientation is found to be least stable and the orientation with both heater and cooler vertical is found to be most stable. Three oscillatory modes were observed in the experiments, two of which are observable only for certain heat addition paths. A hysteresis (conditionally stable) regime wherein stable or unstable flow can prevail depending on the operating procedure is also observed. Generalized steady state equation valid for all the orientations is possible whereas generalized stability equation is possible for a given orientation and flow direction. Steady state flow rate can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using the generalized equation. The stability map predicted by the generalized equation is found to be highly conservative in that its unstable zone is much larger than that observed in the experiments. Both the linear and the nonlinear stability analyses gave the same stability map for identical initial conditions. With nonlinear analysis, it was possible to reproduce the observed unstable oscillatory modes albeit at significantly different power levels. Also, the predicted limit cycles were significantly different in shape which is attributed to the multidimensional nature of the flow especially during the low flow part of the oscillation cycle.},

  abstract = {This study analyzes a transient behavior observed during natural-circulation flow which is not easily placed within the reviewed context. Most of the documented instabilities are either of the ``surge'' type which are driven by inertial effects or changes in flow regimes (this includes quench-dryout instabilities and condensation driven ``chugging''), or they depend on loop wide feedback effects and consequently have a frequency proportional to the fluid transit time (density wave). Although the observed dynamic behavior incorporates some features of both categories, it cannot be adequately described by these mechanisms. It is shown that the system response consists of two sequentially alternating, relatively stable flow phases, which have a source-sink imbalance of opposite sign. These flow phases can persist for lengthy periods of time (long in comparison to the fluid transit time). This is of importance because it implies that in analyzing the behavior of the system, time averaging methods cannot be used.},

Uniform heat flux for heating as well as cooling has been considered along with the constant physical properties, uniform pressure inside the loop and water-steam as the working fluid. For the given operating range and loop geometry, the circulation velocity lies in the turbulent regime. The flow rate monotonically increases with the loop height. However, with heat flux it initially increases, reaches maximum and then falls. This implies that the surface heat flux should match the loop geometry and other operating parameters to produce the maximum flow rate. It has also been observed that the cooling and heating lengths and the temperature of the liquid at the entry of the heating section have to be selected optimally to generate the maximum mass flow rate.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2004.04.012},
  abstract = {In this paper, a series of experiments have been carried out to study different boiling instability modes of water flowing in microchannels at various heat flux and mass flux with the outlet of the channels at atmospheric pressure. Eight parallel silicon microchannels, with an identical trapezoidal cross-section having a hydraulic diameter of 186 $\mu$m and a length of 30 mm, were used in this experiment. When the wall heat flux was increased from 13.5 to 22.6 W/cm2 and the time average mass flux of water was decreased from 14.6 to 11.2 g/cm2 s, three kinds of unstable boiling modes were observed in the microchannels. These were (1) the liquid/two-phase alternating flow (LTAF) at low heat flux and high mass flux, (2) the continuous two-phase flow (CTF) at medium heat flux and medium mass flux, and (3) the liquid/two-phase/vapor alternating flow (LTVAF) at high heat flux and low mass flux. Simultaneously, periodic oscillations of wall temperature, inlet and outlet water temperatures and pressures, and instantaneous mass flux were measured. Among the three unstable boiling modes, oscillation amplitudes in LTVAF were the largest with oscillations of pressures and mass flux nearly out of phase. Oscillation amplitudes in CTF were the smallest with oscillations of pressures and mass flux nearly in phase. Oscillation amplitudes in LTAF lied in between LTVAF and CTF with oscillations of pressures and mass flux nearly out of phase. Also, the oscillation period (including two-phase period, liquid period and vapor period) depends greatly on the amounts of heat flux and mass flux. Bubbly flow and some peculiar two-phase flow patterns were observed in the microchannels during two-phase flow periods.},

To explain the nature of these oscillations, a preliminary analysis with the general expression of the characteristic equation was introduced. The characteristic equation which is a function of the residence times in each flow region can be used to obtain the stability criteria. A simplified analytical approach showed that the short-period oscillations were representative of manometric oscillations, which can also be confirmed by simplifying the characteristic equation. The longer period oscillations infer the density wave oscillation which has the oscillatory period close to the residence time of a fluid around the loop.},

The results have been formulated as Releases of the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam, IAPWS (1996, 2006, 2008) and are expected to be adopted internationally by other organizations in subsequent years. In order to successfully perform computations such as phase equilibria from combinations of these potential functions, mutual compatibility and consistency of these independent mathematical functions must be ensured. In this article, a brief review of their separate development and ranges of validity is given. We analyse background details on the conditions specified at their reference states, the triple point and the standard ocean state, to ensure the mutual consistency of the different formulations, and the necessity and possibility of numerically evaluating metastable states of liquid water. Computed from this formulation in quadruple precision (128-bit floating point numbers), tables of numerical reference values are provided as anchor points for the consistent incorporation of additional potential functions in the future, and as unambiguous benchmarks to be used in the determination of numerical uncertainty estimates of double-precision implementations on different platforms that may be customized for special purposes.},

The solution of the one-dimensional governing conservation equations is performed by a combination of analytical and numerical stages. The method is implicit, to treat the highly nonlinear problem by multinested iteration loops. Results are presented and discussed for the multiple solutions of the flow rate, temperature, quality and void distributions and two-phase elevations. Pressure effects are also studied.

Des. 192 (1999) 31] to develop a nonlinear numerical model for a double-channel two-phase natural circulation loop. The calculated steady-state results provide a reasonable agreement against the experimental data in the high power region but overestimate in the low power region under both equal-heating and unequal-heating conditions. Nonlinear dynamics and stability boundary of the double-channel boiling natural circulation loop are also analyzed. Two unstable regions, type-I and type-II instabilities, are found in this system. Complex channel-to-channel interactions coupling with loop dynamics may occur in the double-channel natural circulation loop. For the equal-heating system, out-of-phase oscillations may prevail under the operating conditions that the gravitational pressure drops are very highly dominant, such as low subcooling and low power conditions. However, in-phase oscillations may exist in the medium to high power regions, where two-phase frictions are relatively important. For the unequal-heating system, the heating power difference between two channels may drive the system more unstable both in type-I and type-II regions. The two unequal-heating channels exhibit in-phase oscillation mode, instead of out-of-phase in the equal-heating system, at low subcooling and low power conditions. In addition, parametric effects on the stability are also evaluated in this study.},

These oscillations could induce boiling crisis, disturb control systems, or cause mechanical damage. This paper identifies the causes and mechanisms of these instabilities. Based on their mechanisms, various types of instabilities are classified and tabulated. The parametric effects on flow instability, observed experimentally, are systematically presented. Various analytical techniques for predicting the instability threshold are reviewed in terms of their applicability and accuracy.},

  abstract = {This book describes the classical aspects of the variational calculus which are of interest to analysts, geometers and physicists alike. Volume 1 deals with the for mal apparatus of the variational calculus and with nonparametric field theory, whereas Volume 2 treats parametric variational problems as well as Hamilton Jacobi theory and the classical theory of partial differential equations of first ordel;. In a subsequent treatise we shall describe developments arising from Hilbert's 19th and 20th problems, especially direct methods and regularity theory. Of the classical variational calculus we have particularly emphasized the often neglected theory of inner variations, i. e. of variations of the independent variables, which is a source of useful information such as mono tonicity for mulas, conformality relations and conservation laws. The combined variation of dependent and independent variables leads to the general conservation laws of Emmy Noether, an important tool in exploiting symmetries. Other parts of this volume deal with Legendre-Jacobi theory and with field theories. In particular we give a detailed presentation of one-dimensional field theory for nonpara metric and parametric integrals and its relations to Hamilton-Jacobi theory, geometrical optics and point mechanics. Moreover we discuss various ways of exploiting the notion of convexity in the calculus of variations, and field theory is certainly the most subtle method to make use of convexity. We also stress the usefulness of the concept of a null Lagrangian which plays an important role in we give an exposition of Hamilton-Jacobi several instances.},

These equations describe a wide range of wave propagation and transport phenomena arising in nearly every scientific and engineering discipline. Several applications are described in a self-contained manner, along with much of the mathematical theory of hyperbolic problems. High-resolution versions of Godunov's method are developed, in which Riemann problems are solved to determine the local wave structure and limiters are then applied to eliminate numerical oscillations. These methods were originally designed to capture shock waves accurately, but are also useful tools for studying linear wave-propagation problems, particularly in heterogenous material. The methods studied are implemented in the CLAWPACK software package and source code for all the examples presented can be found on the web, along with animations of many of the simulations. This provides an excellent learning environment for understanding wave propagation phenomena and finite volume methods.},

  abstract = {In this paper, two-phase flow instability in natural circulation loops of China Advanced Research Reactor (CARR) has been investigated. CARR is a low pressure and low power density research reactor. A natural circulation instability analysis model is developed for the natural circulation loop of CARR. The homogeneous flow model is used to establish the system control equations. The non-uniform heating and subcooled boiling heat transfer is included. The accumulation heat of the wall is also included. Numerical method of Gear is employed to solve the system equations documented in terms of ordinary differential equations. According to the calculation results, stability maps of the natural circulation loop, which confirm the presence of an instability region under the conditions of low equilibrium quality in the outlet and low pressure, are obtained. It is a special kind of density wave oscillation (DWO) that occurs in very low equilibrium quality region with the characteristics of geysering and `Type-I' DWO at the same time. The calculation results show such oscillation course clearly. The variations of the mass flow rate, the pressure drop and the boiling boundary are analyzed separately. Especially, the phase-space trajectory of the boiling boundary and the mass flow rate is discussed. Finally the oscillation frequency is discussed. The calculated results have important significance for the safety operation and accidental analysis of CARR.},

  title = {Iterative {{Methods}} for {{Sparse Linear Systems}}},
  isbn = {978-0-89871-534-7},
  abstract = {In the six years that have passed since the publication of the first edition of this book, iterative methods for linear systems have made good progress in scientific and engineering disciplines. This is due in great part to the increased complexity and size of the new generation of linear and nonlinear systems that arise from typical applications. At the same time, parallel computing has penetrated the same application areas, as inexpensive computer power has become broadly available and standard communication languages such as MPI have provided a much needed standardization. This has created an incentive to utilize iterative rather than direct solvers, because the problems solved are typically from threedimensional models for which direct solvers often become ineffective. Another incentive is that iterative methods are far easier to implement on parallel computers. Although iterative methods for linear systems have seen a significant maturation, there are still many open problems. In particular, it still cannot be stated that an arbitrary sparse linear system can be solved iteratively in an efficient way. If physical information about the problem can be exploited, more effective and robust methods can be tailored to the solutions. This strategy is exploited by multigrid methods. In addition, parallel computers necessitate different ways of approaching the problem and solution algorithms that are radically different from classical ones. Several new texts on the subject of this book have appeared since the first edition. Among these are the books by Greenbaum [154] and Meurant [208]. The exhaustive five-volume treatise by G. W. Stewart [273] is likely to become the de facto reference in numerical linear algebra in years to come. The related multigrid literature has also benefited from a few notable additions, including a new edition of the excellent Multigrid Tutorial [65] and a new title by Trottenberg et al. [285]. Most notable among the changes from the first edition is the addition of a sorely needed chapter on multigrid techniques. The chapters that have seen the biggest changes are Chapters 3, 6, 10, and 12. In most cases, the modifications were made to update the material by adding topics that have been developed recently or gained importance in the last few years. In some instances some of the older topics were removed or shortened. For example, the discussion on parallel architecture has been shortened. In the mid-1990s hypercubes and ``fat-trees'' were important topics to teach. This is no longer the case, since manufacturers have taken steps to hide the topology from the user, in the sense that communication has become much less sensitive to the underlying architecture.},

  abstract = {In industry, supercritical water is being used as e.g. separation agent, solvent or coolant due to the unique fluid properties near the critical point. This has lead to the proposal for a nuclear reactor based on supercritical water, operating at a pressure of 25 MPa and bulk temperatures between 280 $^\circ$C and 500 $^\circ$C. The large change of the water density in such a reactor may cause the system to become thermal-hydraulically unstable. Numerical as well as experimental investigation of this phenomenon is therefore essential. The rather high pressure, temperatures and power significantly push up the costs of an experimental facility. For this reason, we propose a scaling procedure based on Freon R-23 as the working fluid so that (i) pressure, power and temperatures are significantly reduced and (ii) the physics determining the dynamics of the system are almost completely preserved. Practical issues, such as the onset of deterioration of heat transfer, are touched upon as well.},

  abstract = {We present a new finite-difference numerical method to solve the incompressible Navier\textendash{}Stokes equations using a collocated discretization in space on a logically Cartesian grid. The method shares some common aspects with, and it was inspired by, the Box scheme. It uses centered second-order-accurate finite-difference approximations for the spatial derivatives combined with semi-implicit time integration. The proposed method is constructed to ensure discrete conservation of mass and momentum by discretizing the primitive velocity\textendash{}pressure form of the equations. The continuity equation is enforced exactly (to machine accuracy) at the collocated locations, whereas the momentum equations are evaluated in a staggered manner. This formulation preempts the appearance of spurious pressure modes in the embedded elliptic problem associated with the pressure. The method shows uniform order of accuracy, both in space and time, for velocity and pressure. In addition, the skew-symmetric form of the non-linear advection term of the Navier\textendash{}Stokes equations improves discrete conservation of kinetic energy in the inviscid limit, to within the order of the truncation error of the time integrator. The method has been formulated to accommodate different types of boundary conditions; fully periodic, periodic channel, inflow-outflow and lid-driven cavity; always ensuring global mass conservation. A novel aspect of this finite-difference formulation is the derivation of the discretization near boundaries using the weak form of the equations, as in the finite element method. The method of manufactured solutions is utilized to perform accuracy analysis and verification of the solver. To assess the applicability of the new method presented in this paper, four realistic flow problems have been simulated and results are compared with those in the literature. These cases include a lid-driven cavity, backward-facing step, Kovasznay flow, and fully developed turbulent channel.},

A MELCOR core degradation calculation was conducted at the University of Wisconsin\textendash{}Madison under the help of Sandia.

Through this work, the performance of MELCOR COR package was reviewed in detail. This paper compares the hydrogen generation rates predicted by MELCOR to the CORA test data. While agreement is reasonable it could be improved. Additionally, the MELCOR zirconium oxidation model was analyzed.},

  abstract = {For a scalar conservation law \$u\_t  = f(u)\_x \$ with \$f''\$ of constant sign, the first order upwind difference scheme is a special case of Godunov's method. The method is equivalent to solving a sequence of Riemann problems at each step and averaging the resulting solution over each cell in order to obtain the numerical solution at the next time level. The difference scheme is stable (and the solutions to the associated sequence of Riemann problems do not interact) provided the Courant number v is less than 1. By allowing and explicitly handling such interactions, it is possible to obtain a generalized method which is stable for v much larger than 1. In many cases the resulting solution is considerably more accurate than solutions obtained by other numerical methods. In particular, shocks can be correctly computed with virtually no smearing. The generalized method is rather unorthodox and still has some problems associated with it. Nonetheless, preliminary results are quite encouraging.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.nucengdes.2010.12.019},
  abstract = {The determination of single-phase friction factor of pipe flow is essential to a variety of industrial applications, such as single-phase flow systems, two-phase flow systems and supercritical flow systems. There are a number of correlations for the single-phase friction factor. It still remains an issue to examine similarities and differences between them to avoid misusing. This paper evaluates the correlations for the single-phase friction factor against the Nikuradse equation and the Colebrook equation, respectively. These two equations are the base for the turbulent portion of the Moody diagram, and are deemed as the standard to test the explicit counterparts. The widely used correlations for smooth pipes, the Blasius correlation and the Filonenko correlation, have big errors in some Re ranges. Simpler forms of the single-phase friction factor covering large ranges are needed. For this reason, two new correlations of single-phase friction factor for turbulent flow are proposed, one for smooth pipes and the other for both smooth and rough pipes. Compared with the Nikuradse equation, the new correlation for smooth pipes has the mean absolute relative error of 0.022\%, with the maximum relative error of -0.045\% in the Reynolds number (Re) range from 3000 through 108. It is an idea replacement of the correlations of Blasius and Filonenko. The new correlation for both smooth and rough pipes has the mean absolute relative error of 0.16\% and the maximum relative error of 0.50\% compared with the Colebrook equation in the range of Re = 3000\textendash{}108 and Rr = 0.0\textendash{}0.05, which is the most simplest correlation in that error band.},

This study concluded that, within the experimental range, the inlet temperature, heating power and the presence of the unheated bypass channel are the three most dominant factors affecting the loop instability. The Taguchi method is found to be very efficient and there is a great deal of saving in the experimental work. The 20 runs of experiment based on the Taguchi method suggests that the stability of the present two-phase natural circulation loop (TPNCL) would be improved under the following conditions: decreased inlet temperature, decreased thermal load, disconnected unheated bypass channel, installing the compressible volume with a higher water level in the downstream two-phase flow region, disconnected upstream compressible volume, increased single-phase flow restrictions, and decreased two-phase flow restrictions. Although the same trends bear the standard method of stabilizing a boiling channel, the restriction factors in the present experimental investigation are found to be ineffective in dampening the thermal\textendash{}hydraulic instability.},

  abstract = {Many advanced reactor designs incorporate passive systems mainly to enhance the operational safety and possible elimination of severe accident condition. Some reactors are even designed to remove the nominal fission heat passively by natural circulation without using mechanical pumps e.g. ESBWR, AHWR, CHTR, CAREM, etc. while in most other new reactor concepts, the decay heat is removed passively by natural circulation following the pump trip conditions. The design and safety analysis of these reactors are carried out using the best estimate codes such as RELAP5, TRAC and CATHARE, etc. These best estimate codes have been developed for pumped circulation systems and it is not proven about their adequacy or applicability for natural circulation systems wherein the driving mechanism is completely different. Some of the key phenomena which are difficult to model but are significantly important to assess the natural circulation system performances are \textendash{} low flow natural circulation mainly because the flow is not fully developed and can be multi-dimensional in nature; flow instabilities; critical heat flux under oscillatory condition; flow stratification particularly in large diameter vessel; thermal stratification in large pools; effect of non-condensable gases on condensation, etc. Though, these best estimate codes use a six equation two-fluid model formulation for the thermal-hydraulic calculation which is considered to be the best representative of two-phase flows, but their accuracies depend on the accuracies of the models for interfacial relationships for mass, energy and momentum transfer which are semi-empirical in nature. The other problem with two-fluid models is the effect of ill-posedness which may cause numerical instability. Besides, the numerical diffusion associated due to truncation of higher order terms can affect the prediction of flow instabilities. All these effects may lead to inability to capture the important physical instability in natural circulation systems and instability characteristics i.e. amplitude and frequency of flow oscillation. In view of this, it is essential to test the capability of these codes to simulate natural circulation behavior under single and two-phase flow conditions before applying them to the future reactor concepts. In the present study, one of the extensively used best estimate code RELAP5 has been used for simulation of steady state, transient and stability behavior of natural circulation based experimental facilities, such as the High-Pressure Natural Circulation Loop (HPNCL) and the Parallel Channel Loop (PCL) installed and operating at BARC. The test data have been generated for a range of pressure, power and subcooling conditions. The computer code RELAP5/MOD3.2 was applied to predict the transient natural circulation characteristics under single-phase and two-phase conditions, thresholds of flow instability, amplitude and frequency of flow oscillations for different operating conditions of the loops. This paper presents the effect of nodalisation in prediction of natural circulation behavior in test facilities and a comparison of experimental data in with that of code predictions. The errors associated with the predictions are also characterized.},

An increase in the inlet-restriction and/or decrease in the exit-restriction broadened the range of the continuous circulation mode and stabilized the system. When the liquid charging level was lowered or the inlet subcooling was decreased, the continuous circulation mode started at a lower heat flux and the system became stable. The results are summarized on instability maps in the plane of heat flux vs. inlet subcooling.},

  abstract = {The state-of-the-art of theoretical investigations on the flow oscillations that occur in a boiling natural circulation loop has been presented here. Motivation behind the work is to develop a high-fidelity model that is capable of predicting nature of flow instabilities more accurately. At the low pressures and low heat fluxes conditions, the major four types of instabilities may occur in boiling natural circulation loop depending on operating conditions: Flow excursion, Geysering instability, Flashing-induced instability and Type I density-wave oscillations. The characteristics of different instabilities as well as the effects of different operating and geometric parameters on them have been reviewed. The objective of this review is to gather the research findings on the nonlinear stability phenomena in various boiling flow channel systems over a period of several years. This review indicates that most of the theoretical predictions of amplitudes and periods of the sustained oscillations are carried out using two models, namely, homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM) (still debatable) and drift-flux model (DFM) (more realistic) and are validated by experimental findings. This review work on theoretical investigations presented in this paper indicates that there are enough scopes for improving mathematical formulations of the natural circulation boiling loop (NCBL) for thermohydraulic instabilities.},

The nitrogen-water system has been used to isolate the key hydrodynamic phenomena from heat transfer problems. Various tests were carried out to establish the basic mechanism of the flow termination and reestablishment as well as to obtain essential information on scale effects of various parameters such as the loop frictional resistance, thermal center, U-bend curvature, and inlet geometry. It was found that the permanent termination of the natural circulation was related to the head balance between the hot and cold legs. The local flow condition at the inverted U-bend could produce intermittent flow, however was not related to the permanent flow termination. The void distribution in a hot leg, flow regime, and natural circulation rate have been measured in detail for various conditions. Significant effects of the inlet geometry on these were observed. Near the flow termination condition, large amplitude flow oscillations occurred. The occurrence of this type of flow instability is important for safety analyses, because it may lead to loop-to-loop oscillations or flow excursions in a prototype system which has a multi-loop configuration.},

Existing finite difference schemes in regular and staggered grid systems are checked for violations of the conservation requirements and a few important discrepancies are pointed out. In particular, it is found that none of the existing higher order schemes for a staggered mesh system simultaneously conserve mass, momentum, and kinetic energy. This deficiency is corrected through the derivation of a general family of fully conservative higher order accurate finite difference schemes for staggered grid systems. Finite difference schemes in a collocated grid system are also analyzed, and a violation of kinetic energy conservation is revealed. The predicted conservation properties are demonstrated numerically in simulations of inviscid white noise, performed in a two-dimensional periodic domain. The proposed fourth order schemes in a staggered grid system are generalized for the case of a non-uniform mesh, and the resulting scheme is used to perform large eddy simulations of turbulent channel flow.},

  abstract = {The heat transport capability of natural circulation loops is directly proportional to the flow rate it can generate. Therefore, reliable prediction of flow rate is essential for design and performance evaluation of natural circulation loops. The reported generalized flow equation applicable for single-phase natural circulation is only valid for cases where the entire loop follows a single friction law. Such a situation arises when the natural circulation loop is either fully laminar or fully turbulent. It is possible that a natural circulation loop can be partly laminar and partly in transition or turbulent flow. In such cases, a single friction law is not applicable throughout the loop. In the present study, a generalized flow equation is proposed for cases where a single friction law is not applicable for the entire loop. The proposed equation is tested with experimental data generated in a uniform diameter rectangular loop and is found to be in good agreement. Subsequently the equation is tested with data reported in the literature. Stability analysis reported in literature for single-phase loops are either for laminar or turbulent flows. In practice, in natural circulation loops, all the flow regimes like laminar, transition and turbulent are observed. Therefore, it is required to develop a stability map, which is valid for all the three regions. In the present paper, such a stability map is presented.},

The work previously performed by the Authors in relation to Welander's problem and other relevant single-phase thermosyphon loop cases is reviewed, with main emphasis on the adopted methodology, based on numerical discretization of governing equations. These results serve to illustrate how time domain codes may be used to analyze such problems and also to highlight the effect of considering different constitutive laws in the computed linear stability map. Reference to the application of this methodology to boiling channel stability analysis is also made to demonstrate its generality. The results show both the qualitative and quantitative details of the changes that stability maps undergo as a consequence of numerical discretization of governing equations. The recent attempt to make easier the application of the methodology by the use of automatic fortran code differentiation tools is finally reported, showing quantitative results concerning calculation of the sensitivity of simulation results to physical and numerical parameters.},

  abstract = {A new class of implicit high-order non-oscillatory time integration schemes is introduced in a method-of-lines framework. These schemes can be used in conjunction with an appropriate spatial discretization scheme for the numerical solution of time dependent conservation equations. The main concept behind these schemes is that the order of accuracy in time is dropped locally in regions where the time evolution of the solution is not smooth. By doing this, an attempt is made at locally satisfying monotonicity conditions, while maintaining a high order of accuracy in most of the solution domain. When a linear high order time integration scheme is used along with a high order spatial discretization, enforcement of monotonicity imposes severe time-step restrictions. We propose to apply limiters to these time-integration schemes, thus making them non-linear. When these new schemes are used with high order spatial discretizations, solutions remain non-oscillatory for much larger time-steps as compared to linear time integration schemes. Numerical results obtained on scalar conservation equations and systems of conservation equations are highly promising.},

Such conditions favor flashing-induced instabilities due to the large hydrostatic pressure drop induced by the tall chimney. Moreover, in novel NC-BWR designs the steam separation is performed in the steam separators which create large pressure drops at the chimney outlet, which effect on stability has not been investigated yet. In this work, flashing-induced oscillations occurring in a tall, bottom heated channel are numerically investigated by using a simple linear model with three regions and an accurate implementation for estimating the water properties. The model is used to investigate flashing-induced instabilities in a channel for different values of the core inlet friction value. The results are compared with experiments obtained by using the CIRCUS facility at the same conditions, showing a good agreement. In addition, the experiments on flashing-induced instabilities are presented in a novel manner allowing visualizing new details of the phenomenon numerical stability investigations on the effect of the friction distribution are also done. It is found that by increasing the total restriction in the channel the system is destabilized. In addition, the chimney outlet restriction has a stronger destabilizing effect than the core inlet restriction. A stable two-phase region is observed prior to the instabilities in the experiments and the numerical simulations which may help to pressurize the vessel of NC-BWRs and thus reducing the effects of flashing instabilities during start-up.},

These were: the liquid/two-phase alternating flow (LTAF) at two different heat fluxes, the continuous two-phase flow (CTF) at medium heat flux and medium mass flux, and the liquid/two-phase/vapor alternating flow (LTVAF) at high heat flux and low mass flux. In this paper, data of these unstable boiling cases are analyzed using the following methods: correlation coefficient, attractor reconstruction, correlation dimension and largest Lyapunov exponent. The processes responsible for appearance of chaotic oscillations in microchannels, such as nucleation, stability of bubbly flow, vapour core stability and vapour-phase flow stability, are discussed. It is shown that under certain conditions, the microchannels system works as a thermal oscillator. It was found that heat supplied to the microchannels increases the heating surface temperature while the appearance of the two-phase flow inside the channels decreases the heating surface temperature. The mechanism involving an increase in heating surface temperature is supported by phenomena of blocking the liquid flow in microchannels by the two-phase flow.},

The novel manner of visualizing the results allowed characterizing the facility at any time and position which helped to thoroughly understand the instability mechanisms. Different modes were observed for each configuration. In the case of having two-parallel channels, four different behaviors have been observed: stable flow circulation, periodic high subcooling oscillations, a-periodical oscillations and out-of-phase periodical oscillations. In addition, stability maps were constructed in order to clarify the region in which each mode is dominant.

As a result, some similarities have been observed between the intermittent flow oscillations found in the single channel experiments and the high subcooling oscillations found in the two-parallel channels experiments. Moreover, similarities have also been found between the sinusoidal flow oscillations existing in the single channel experiments and the out-of-phase oscillations from the two-parallel channels experiments.

  abstract = {Strong stability preserving (SSP) high order time discretizations were developed to ensure nonlinear stability properties necessary in the numerical solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations with discontinuous solutions. SSP methods preserve the strong stability properties\textemdash{}in any norm, seminorm or convex functional\textemdash{}of the spatial discretization coupled with first order Euler time stepping. This paper describes the development of SSP methods and the connections between the timestep restrictions for strong stability preservation and contractivity. Numerical examples demonstrate that common linearly stable but not strong stability preserving time discretizations may lead to violation of important boundedness properties, whereas SSP methods guarantee the desired properties provided only that these properties are satisfied with forward Euler timestepping. We review optimal explicit and implicit SSP Runge\textendash{}Kutta and multistep methods, for linear and nonlinear problems. We also discuss the SSP properties of spectral deferred correction methods.},

  abstract = {Effect of the heater and cooler orientations on the single-phase natural circulation was studied in a rectangular loop. From steady state considerations, the maximum flow for a specified operating condition is achievable for the orientation with both the heater and the cooler horizontal. However, this orientation is found to be least stable and the orientation with both heater and cooler vertical is found to be most stable. Three oscillatory modes were observed in the experiments, two of which are observable only for certain heat addition paths. A hysteresis (conditionally stable) regime wherein stable or unstable flow can prevail depending on the operating procedure is also observed. Generalized steady state equation valid for all the orientations is possible whereas generalized stability equation is possible for a given orientation and flow direction. Steady state flow rate can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using the generalized equation. The stability map predicted by the generalized equation is found to be highly conservative in that its unstable zone is much larger than that observed in the experiments. Both the linear and the nonlinear stability analyses gave the same stability map for identical initial conditions. With nonlinear analysis, it was possible to reproduce the observed unstable oscillatory modes albeit at significantly different power levels. Also, the predicted limit cycles were significantly different in shape which is attributed to the multidimensional nature of the flow especially during the low flow part of the oscillation cycle.},

  abstract = {This study analyzes a transient behavior observed during natural-circulation flow which is not easily placed within the reviewed context. Most of the documented instabilities are either of the ``surge'' type which are driven by inertial effects or changes in flow regimes (this includes quench-dryout instabilities and condensation driven ``chugging''), or they depend on loop wide feedback effects and consequently have a frequency proportional to the fluid transit time (density wave). Although the observed dynamic behavior incorporates some features of both categories, it cannot be adequately described by these mechanisms. It is shown that the system response consists of two sequentially alternating, relatively stable flow phases, which have a source-sink imbalance of opposite sign. These flow phases can persist for lengthy periods of time (long in comparison to the fluid transit time). This is of importance because it implies that in analyzing the behavior of the system, time averaging methods cannot be used.},

Uniform heat flux for heating as well as cooling has been considered along with the constant physical properties, uniform pressure inside the loop and water-steam as the working fluid. For the given operating range and loop geometry, the circulation velocity lies in the turbulent regime. The flow rate monotonically increases with the loop height. However, with heat flux it initially increases, reaches maximum and then falls. This implies that the surface heat flux should match the loop geometry and other operating parameters to produce the maximum flow rate. It has also been observed that the cooling and heating lengths and the temperature of the liquid at the entry of the heating section have to be selected optimally to generate the maximum mass flow rate.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a series of experiments have been carried out to study different boiling instability modes of water flowing in microchannels at various heat flux and mass flux with the outlet of the channels at atmospheric pressure. Eight parallel silicon microchannels, with an identical trapezoidal cross-section having a hydraulic diameter of 186 $\mu$m and a length of 30 mm, were used in this experiment. When the wall heat flux was increased from 13.5 to 22.6 W/cm2 and the time average mass flux of water was decreased from 14.6 to 11.2 g/cm2 s, three kinds of unstable boiling modes were observed in the microchannels. These were (1) the liquid/two-phase alternating flow (LTAF) at low heat flux and high mass flux, (2) the continuous two-phase flow (CTF) at medium heat flux and medium mass flux, and (3) the liquid/two-phase/vapor alternating flow (LTVAF) at high heat flux and low mass flux. Simultaneously, periodic oscillations of wall temperature, inlet and outlet water temperatures and pressures, and instantaneous mass flux were measured. Among the three unstable boiling modes, oscillation amplitudes in LTVAF were the largest with oscillations of pressures and mass flux nearly out of phase. Oscillation amplitudes in CTF were the smallest with oscillations of pressures and mass flux nearly in phase. Oscillation amplitudes in LTAF lied in between LTVAF and CTF with oscillations of pressures and mass flux nearly out of phase. Also, the oscillation period (including two-phase period, liquid period and vapor period) depends greatly on the amounts of heat flux and mass flux. Bubbly flow and some peculiar two-phase flow patterns were observed in the microchannels during two-phase flow periods.},

To explain the nature of these oscillations, a preliminary analysis with the general expression of the characteristic equation was introduced. The characteristic equation which is a function of the residence times in each flow region can be used to obtain the stability criteria. A simplified analytical approach showed that the short-period oscillations were representative of manometric oscillations, which can also be confirmed by simplifying the characteristic equation. The longer period oscillations infer the density wave oscillation which has the oscillatory period close to the residence time of a fluid around the loop.},

The solution of the one-dimensional governing conservation equations is performed by a combination of analytical and numerical stages. The method is implicit, to treat the highly nonlinear problem by multinested iteration loops. Results are presented and discussed for the multiple solutions of the flow rate, temperature, quality and void distributions and two-phase elevations. Pressure effects are also studied.

The calculated steady-state results provide a reasonable agreement against the experimental data in the high power region but overestimate in the low power region under both equal-heating and unequal-heating conditions. Nonlinear dynamics and stability boundary of the double-channel boiling natural circulation loop are also analyzed. Two unstable regions, type-I and type-II instabilities, are found in this system. Complex channel-to-channel interactions coupling with loop dynamics may occur in the double-channel natural circulation loop. For the equal-heating system, out-of-phase oscillations may prevail under the operating conditions that the gravitational pressure drops are very highly dominant, such as low subcooling and low power conditions. However, in-phase oscillations may exist in the medium to high power regions, where two-phase frictions are relatively important. For the unequal-heating system, the heating power difference between two channels may drive the system more unstable both in type-I and type-II regions. The two unequal-heating channels exhibit in-phase oscillation mode, instead of out-of-phase in the equal-heating system, at low subcooling and low power conditions. In addition, parametric effects on the stability are also evaluated in this study.},

  abstract = {We present a new finite-difference numerical method to solve the incompressible Navier\textendash{}Stokes equations using a collocated discretization in space on a logically Cartesian grid. The method shares some common aspects with, and it was inspired by, the Box scheme. It uses centered second-order-accurate finite-difference approximations for the spatial derivatives combined with semi-implicit time integration. The proposed method is constructed to ensure discrete conservation of mass and momentum by discretizing the primitive velocity\textendash{}pressure form of the equations. The continuity equation is enforced exactly (to machine accuracy) at the collocated locations, whereas the momentum equations are evaluated in a staggered manner. This formulation preempts the appearance of spurious pressure modes in the embedded elliptic problem associated with the pressure. The method shows uniform order of accuracy, both in space and time, for velocity and pressure. In addition, the skew-symmetric form of the non-linear advection term of the Navier\textendash{}Stokes equations improves discrete conservation of kinetic energy in the inviscid limit, to within the order of the truncation error of the time integrator. The method has been formulated to accommodate different types of boundary conditions; fully periodic, periodic channel, inflow-outflow and lid-driven cavity; always ensuring global mass conservation. A novel aspect of this finite-difference formulation is the derivation of the discretization near boundaries using the weak form of the equations, as in the finite element method. The method of manufactured solutions is utilized to perform accuracy analysis and verification of the solver. To assess the applicability of the new method presented in this paper, four realistic flow problems have been simulated and results are compared with those in the literature. These cases include a lid-driven cavity, backward-facing step, Kovasznay flow, and fully developed turbulent channel.},

This is the latest heat sink designed to ensure the cooling down of the vessel and other structural materials during an accident scenario. An experimental facility was built at Texas A\&amp;M to quantitatively analyze heat transfer phenomena and the air flow regime inside the reactor cavity. The thermal measurements were performed using 18 thermocouples mounted on the vessel surface, 8 on the external surface of one of the cooling pipes and 24 on a movable rack that captures the axial temperature profile inside the cavity. Flow regime measurements were performed with Particle Tracking Velocimetry techniques (PTV), using a high speed camera and spraying a special dust in the cavity for the tracking. The results demonstrate that the main heat transfer mode inside the cavity is the radiation (about 80\%); also, they show the complexity of the flow regime inside the cavity due to natural circulation. The experimental conditions were a vessel surface temperature of about 300 $^\circ$C heated at fixed power and different flow rates for the cooling pipes.},

The practical ability of coated fuel particles to quantitatively retain important fission products up to 1600\textendash{}1700$^\circ$C has been demonstrated in the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), and the United States (USA) is proceeding with similar demonstrations. The USA program has placed emphasis on development of fuel performance models, using experimental data for that development. The mathematical models predict high retention of fission products for reference-quality MHTGR fuel, and the predictions are supported by the FRG experimental data. The performance of USA fabricated fuel has not been as high as expected, and additional development is needed. Specific safety analyses and results obtained from various ``bounding'' type accidents based on reference-quality fuel support the claimed high degree of inherent safety of MHTGRs.},

  abstract = {The collocated-mesh scheme is often favored over the staggered-mesh scheme for turbulence simulation in complex geometries due to its simpler form in curvilinear coordinates. The collocated mesh scheme does not conserve kinetic energy however, and few careful checks of the impact of these errors have been made. In this work, analysis is used to identify two sources of kinetic energy conservation error in the collocated-mesh scheme: (1) errors arising from the interpolations used to estimate the velocity on the cell faces, and (2) errors associated with the slightly inconsistent pressure field used to ensure mass conservation for the cell face volume fluxes. It is shown that the interpolation error can be eliminated through the use of first-order accurate centered interpolation operators with mesh-independent weights. The pressure error appears to be intrinsic to the scheme and it is shown to scale as O($\Delta$t2$\Delta$x2). The effects of the conservation errors are investigated numerically through simulations of inviscid flow over an airfoil and in large eddy simulations of turbulent channel flow. Neither the interpolation error nor the pressure error appear to lead to significant problems in the channel flow simulations where viscous dissipation is present and where the Cartesian mesh is stretched in only one direction. The inviscid airfoil simulations performed on a curvilinear mesh show a much greater sensitivity to the interpolation error. The standard second-order centered interpolation is shown to lead to severe numerical oscillations, while the kinetic energy-conserving first-order centered interpolation produces solutions that are almost as smooth as those obtained with a third-order upwind interpolation. When compared in channel flow simulations, however, the first-order centered interpolation is shown to be far superior to the third-order upwind interpolation, the latter being adversely affected by numerical dissipation. Only slight differences were noted when comparing channel flow simulations using first-order and second-order centered interpolations. These results suggest that numerical oscillations can be controlled in curvilinear coordinates through the use of properly-constructed non-dissipative centered interpolations.},

The effect of inlet subcooling and heating flux on the system instability is simulated under the system pressure Psys = 1.5 MPa. The numerical results show that there exist two instability inlet subcooling boundaries at different heat flux. The numerical results show good agreement with the experimental results on HRTL-5 without consideration of point neutron kinetics. If coupled with point neutron kinetics, the system will exhibit little difference on instability boundaries from that without considering the nuclear characteristics. But the amplitude and the phase of the oscillation of the thermal hydraulic parameters of the system will be somehow affected in unstable zone if the system is coupled with point neutron kinetics.},

The relationship between flow reversal and the onset of geysering is studied in particular. It makes clear that geysering in parallel boiling channels in natural circulation is fundamentally identical to that in forced circulation. Next, the effects of a large bubble covering the entire flow cross section and subcooling in the outlet plenum upon the occurrence of geysering are clarified. Finally, differences in behavior of geysering in a single channel as compared with that in parallel channels are discussed.},

Experimental results indicate that the characteristics of the thermal hydraulic oscillations can be periodic, with 2\textendash{}5 fundamental frequencies, or chaotic, depending on the heating power and inlet subcooling. The number of fundamental frequencies of oscillation increases if the inlet subcooling is increased at a given heating power or the heating power is decreased at a given inlet subcooling; chaotic oscillations appear if the inlet subcooling is further increased and/or the heating power is further decreased. A map of the oscillation characteristics is thus established. The change in oscillation characteristics is evident from the time evolution and power spectrum of a thermal hydraulic parameter and the phase portraits of two thermal hydraulic parameters. These results reveal that a strange attractor exists in a low pressure two-phase natural circulation loop with low power and very high inlet subcooling.},

The theoretical model considers a four-equation drift flux model which solves the linearised conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy applicable to boiling two-phase natural circulation systems. The model was applied to three boiling natural circulation loops wherein Type I and Type II instabilities were observed over a wide range of operating pressures. The two-phase friction loss was predicted using different friction factor multiplier models available in literature. It was found that these models influence the steady state and threshold powers for stability, especially the Type II instabilities in natural circulation significantly. Since the void fraction depends on the drift velocity and the void distribution parameter in two-phase flow, these parameters were varied and their effects on the natural circulation flow stability were investigated. It was found that an increase in either the drift velocity or the void distribution parameter reduces the unstable regions observed in the Type I or Type II flow instabilities in two-phase natural circulation systems. Further, investigations were carried out to study the effect of loop diameter on the Type I and Type II instabilities in natural circulation. This study is important to reveal the capability of the reduced diameter scaled facilities of the prototype systems to simulate natural circulation instabilities. The results indicate that with increase in the loop diameter, the threshold power of the Type I instability and the Type II instability increases. Moreover, the stability of natural circulation greatly enhances with increase in the diameter of the loop.},

The objective of this review is to sum up the experimental and theoretical work carried out by various investigators over a period of several years, demonstrating and explaining three main instability modes of two-phase flow dynamic instabilities, namely, density-wave type, pressure-drop type and thermal oscillations, encountered in various boiling flow channel systems. The typical experimental investigations of these instabilities in tube boiling systems are indicated and the most popular models to predict the two-phase flow dynamic instabilities, namely the homogenous flow model and the drift-flux models are clarified with the solution examples and the validation of the model results with experimental findings are also provided.},

  abstract = {Recently, many concepts, in which passive and simplified functions are actively adapted, have been proposed for the next generation LWRs. The natural circulation BWR is one such proposal. In this paper, advantages and disadvantages of the natural circulation BWR are considered from the requirements for next generation LWRs as compared with current BWRs. It is pointed out from this consideration that a thermo-hydraulic instability, which may appear during start-up, greatly influences concept feasibility because its occurrence makes operation for raising power output difficult. Thermo-hydraulic instabilities are investigated experimentally under conditions simulating normal and abnormal start-up processes. It is clarified that three kinds of thermo-hydraulic instabilities may occur during start-up in the natural circulation BWR according to its procedure and reactor configuration, which are (1) geysering induced by condensation, (2) natural circulation instability induced by hydrostatic head fluctuation in steam separators and (3) density wave instability. Driving mechanisms of the geysering and the natural circulation instability, which have never understood enough, are inferred from the results. Finally, the difference of thermo-hydraulic behavior during start-up processes between thermal natural circulation boilers and the Dodewaard reactor is discussed.},

  abstract = {In this paper, two-phase flow instability in natural circulation loops of China Advanced Research Reactor (CARR) has been investigated. CARR is a low pressure and low power density research reactor. A natural circulation instability analysis model is developed for the natural circulation loop of CARR. The homogeneous flow model is used to establish the system control equations. The non-uniform heating and subcooled boiling heat transfer is included. The accumulation heat of the wall is also included. Numerical method of Gear is employed to solve the system equations documented in terms of ordinary differential equations. According to the calculation results, stability maps of the natural circulation loop, which confirm the presence of an instability region under the conditions of low equilibrium quality in the outlet and low pressure, are obtained. It is a special kind of density wave oscillation (DWO) that occurs in very low equilibrium quality region with the characteristics of geysering and `Type-I' DWO at the same time. The calculation results show such oscillation course clearly. The variations of the mass flow rate, the pressure drop and the boiling boundary are analyzed separately. Especially, the phase-space trajectory of the boiling boundary and the mass flow rate is discussed. Finally the oscillation frequency is discussed. The calculated results have important significance for the safety operation and accidental analysis of CARR.},

It provides knowledge and mathematical tools for adequate description of the process of transferring the fission heat released in materials due to nuclear reactions into its environment. It step by step introduces into the heat release inside the fuel, temperature fields in the fuels, the "simple" boiling flow in a pipe described using ideas of different complexity like equilibrium, non equilibrium, homogeneity, non homogeneity. Then the "simple" three-fluid boiling flow in a pipe is described by gradually involving the mechanisms like entrainment and deposition, dynamic fragmentation, collisions, coalescence, turbulence. All heat transfer mechanisms are introduced gradually discussing their uncertainty. Different techniques are introduced like boundary layer treatments or integral methods. Comparisons with experimental data at each step demonstrate the success of the different ideas and models. After an introduction of the design of the reactor pressure vessels for pressurized and boiling water reactors the accuracy of the modern methods is demonstrated using large number of experimental data sets for steady and transient flows in heated bundles. Starting with single pipe boiling going through boiling in the rod bundles the analysis of complete vessel including the reactor is finally demonstrated. Then a powerful method for nonlinear stability analysis of flow boiling and condensation is introduced. Models are presented and their accuracies are investigated for describing critical multiphase flow at different level of complexity. Therefore the book presents a complete coverage of the modern Nuclear Thermal Hydrodynamics.This present third edition includes various updates, extensions, improvements and corrections.},

Filling that void for both students and professionals working in different branches of engineering, this versatile instructional resource comprises five flexible, self-contained sections:  Governing Equations deals with the derivation of the basic conservation laws, flow kinematics, and some basic theorems of fluid mechanics.  Ideal-Fluid Flow covers two- and three-dimensional potential flows and surface waves.  Viscous Flows of Incompressible Fluids discusses exact solutions, low-Reynolds-number approximations, boundary-layer theory, and buoyancy-driven flows.  Compressible Flow of Inviscid Fluids addresses shockwaves as well as one- and multidimensional flows.  Methods of Mathematical Analysis summarizes some commonly used analysis techniques. Additional appendices offer a synopsis of vectors, tensors, Fourier series, thermodynamics, and the governing equations in the common coordinate systems. The book identifies the phenomena associated with the various properties of compressible, viscous fluids in unsteady, three-dimensional flow situations. It provides techniques for solving specific types of fluid-flow problems, and it covers the derivation of the basic equations governing the laminar flow of Newtonian fluids, first assessing general situations and then shifting focus to more specific scenarios.  The author illustrates the process of finding solutions to the governing equations. In the process, he reveals both the mathematical methodology and physical phenomena involved in each category of flow situation, which include ideal, viscous, and compressible fluids. This categorization enables a clear explanation of the different solution methods and the basis for the various physical consequences of fluid properties and flow characteristics. Armed with this new understanding, readers can then apply the appropriate equation results to deal with the particular circumstances of their own work.},

The course is taken by first-year graduate students in our department, along with graduate students from mathematics and a variety of science and engineering departments. Exercises and student projects are an important aspect of any such course and many have been developed in conjunction with this book. Rather than lengthening the text, they are available on the book's Web page: www.siam.org/books/OT98 Along with exercises that provide practice and further exploration of the topics in each chapter, some of the exercises introduce methods, techniques, or more advanced topics not found in the book. The Web page also contains MATLAB\textregistered{} m-files that illustrate how to implement finite difference methods, and that may serve as a starting point for further study of the methods in exercises and projects. A number of the exercises require programming on the part of the student, or require changes to the MATLAB programs provided. Some of these exercises are fairly simple, designed to enable students to observe first hand the behavior of numerical methods described in the text. Others are more open-ended and could form the basis for a course project. The exercises are available as PDF files. The LATEX source is also provided, along with some hints on using LATEX for the type of mathematics used in this field. Each exercise is in a separate file so that instuctors can easily construct customized homework assignments if desired.

Each document is a lavishly illustrated introductory survey of its topic, complete with beautiful numerical experiments and all the right references. The breadth of included topics and the numerous applications that provide links between fields will make this an essential reference in mathematics and related sciences.},

  abstract = {Various empirical equations used for expressing the compressive properties of liquids have been studied. Despite its popularity, the well-known equation attributed to Tait has several undesirable features; moreover, it is in fact not Tait's original equation, but is the result of an accidental misquotation by a later writer. Tait's original equation, when rearranged, leads to an equation of the form V 0 P / V 0 - V = K 0 + mP where K 0 is the bulk modulus at zero pressure and m the slope of the bulk-modulus-pressure curve. The equations of Tumlirz and of Tammann are merely rearrangements of the above equation. The spurious version of the Tait equation, Hudleston's equation, MacDonald's equation and the Van der Waal equation of state are all asymptotic to it at zero pressure, and are practically equivalent to it over the normal range of application. The above equation is both the most accurate and the most convenient two-constant compressibility equation available. By the addition of a term in P 2 the equation can be adapted to fit data for water up to 12 kb; a further term in P 3 is needed to accommodate a wide range of organic liquids up to 12 kb.},

@book{burden_numerical_2004,
  title = {Numerical {{Analysis}}},
  isbn = {978-0-534-39200-0},
  abstract = {This well-respected text gives an introduction to the modern approximation techniques and explains how, why, and when the techniques can be expected to work. The authors focus on building students' intuition to help them understand why the techniques presented work in general, and why, in some situations, they fail. With a wealth of examples and exercises, the text demonstrates the relevance of numerical analysis to a variety of disciplines and provides ample practice for students. The applications chosen demonstrate concisely how numerical methods can be, and often must be, applied in real-life situations. In this edition, the presentation has been fine-tuned to make the book even more useful to the instructor and more interesting to the reader. Overall, students gain a theoretical understanding of, and a firm basis for future study of, numerical analysis and scientific computing. A more applied text with a different menu of topics is the authors' highly regarded NUMERICAL METHODS, Third Edition.Important Notice: Media content referenced within the product description or the product text may not be available in the ebook version.},

@book{nellis_heat_2009,
  title = {Heat {{Transfer}}},
  isbn = {978-0-521-88107-4},
  abstract = {The single objective of this book is to provide engineers with the capability, tools, and confidence to solve real-world heat transfer problems. It includes many advanced topics, such as Bessel functions, Laplace transforms, separation of variables, Duhamel's theorem, and complex combination, as well as high order explicit and implicit numerical integration algorithms. These analytical and numerical solution methods are applied to topics not considered in most textbooks. Examples are heat exchangers involving fluids with varying specific heats or phase changes; heat exchangers in which axial conduction is a concern; and regenerators. To improve readability, derivations of important results are presented completely, without skipping steps, which reduces student frustration and improves retention. The examples in the book are ubiquitous, not trivial "textbook" exercises. They are rather complex and timely real-world problems that are inherently interesting. This textbook integrates the computational software packages Maple, MATLAB, FEHT, and Engineering Equation Solver (EES) directly with the heat transfer material.},
